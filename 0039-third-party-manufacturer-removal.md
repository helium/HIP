# Summary

This proposal seeks to lay out requirements for third-party manufacturers to have both RESPONSIBILITIES and REQUIREMENTS toward the Helium Community and what should happen when they fail to meet expectations. 


# Motivation
Cryto is a risk, we all know that, but what isn't or shouldt be a risk is purchasing equipment from a company that has been approved for helium manufacturing. 

In order to succeed, the Helium network will require ubiquitous, worldwide coverage. Nebra, has failed to act on this and have treated the community very poorly. Helium themselves have failed to react, choosing instead to 
ignore the issue. 

To achieve that level of coverage, we will need a large number of hotspots. We cannot do this when manufacturers are playing games with us. 

Helium Inc have indicated they will no longer produce their original hotspots. So they must rely on third parties, however, they hold the keys to the network, so they still hold responsibility for the bahvaiour of third party
manufacturers, if not, then they should not have closed the DIY program. 

Currently, Nebra is holding many of the community to hostage and all attempts to get information, have led to feuds, to bands, to returned money and canceled to outright lies. 

Helium Inc is currently the only party that can issue the keys required to add a new hotspot to the blockchain. They are also the only party who can prevent the continued abuse of the network. 

They've indicated they would be willing to follow the community's lead for approving new manufacturers and issuing them onboarding keys, they should, also, follow their lead on removing them. 

and this proposal attempts to outline a process for that community approval.


# Stakeholders

Almost everyone involved in the Helium ecosystem, but especially:

- Users who put their trust in Manufacturers

# Detailed Explanation

This document attempts to outline:

1. Requirements and process for removal or third pary manufacturers. 
2. A rough process for Helium Inc to issue steep fines, warnings and eventual removal. 
3. Expectations for software maintenance and customer support from those manufacturers which have not been met. 

For an initial launch, we propose favoring:

- Known community members with demonstrated experience in hardware design and manufacturing
- Large production batch sizes (10s of thousands of hotspots), rather than prototypes or smaller production runs
- Hardware designs that emphasize security and reliability rather than novel designs with more unknowns
- TRUST - when you fail, and repeatabily fail you need to be removed. 

Since this is a brand-new initiative and there is potential for abuse or failure to deliver, we seek to minimize risk. Over time, we would like to open this up to hobbyists, new entrants, and more experimental designs.
This makes this proposal esssential. 


## Application Requirements

Members of the community would be expected to provide:
- Order Numbers, Dates and Customer Support tickets showing all reasonable requests to solve the issues

Manufactuers whom the community is seeking to be removed should have their change to state their case, but must do so in public without hiding behind masks. 
ots participating in PoC, Witnessing, and Challenging will be subject to the ECC chip requirement.**

Lastly, manufacturers are expected to provide:

- Proof of identity for individuals owning 25% or more of the manufacturer, per typical KYC/AML procedure. This could be provided privately to trusted parties like Helium Inc employees or DeWi board members and publicly confirmed.
- A production budget, to further demonstrate progress and expertise with manufacturing.
- Proof of the capital necessary to fund that budget. Ideally we would not be approving vendors who are solely reliant on presales or crowdfunding, to help account for delays, production issues, returns, and other known-unknowns.
- Willingness to engage with the community and provide ongoing customer support

Nebra, have failed on all accounts and we must act. 

While we recognize that much of this information could be considered sensitive or proprietary, we believe it is imperative to build trust with the initial set of manufacturers that are brought in through this process. Thus we ask more of this initial set of manufacturers than we might from later approvals. in Nebra's case, they failed. 


## Revoking Manufacturer Approvals

We suggest a similar HIP-style "rough consensus" process in the case that the community wants to cease issuing codes to an approved manufacturer.

Removing any hotspots associated with that manufacturer is not currently possible. Consideration and approval of this is left to a separate proposal, as it is both technically and philosophically complex.
THIS IS THAT PROPOSAL

For consideration, there is not currently a way to unstake a hotspot on the Helium network. There is also no denylist support, which could be used as to implement community-led blocking of known bad actors. A mechanism for revoking access could potentially be built alongside the key-issuance system mentioned above, but again, this is explicitly left to a future proposal.

We should add these to this porposal for future OTA.
