# Summary

Currently HIP votes are conducted via wallet signatures at heliumvote.com; this proposal suggests further improvement
by constraining a given entities voting power to equal the total number of network entities (hotspots, validators, routers), rather than
by the balance of a voting wallet. The vote should be weighted accordingly to incorporate the relative network utility value contributed
by a given entity respectively.

# Motivation

There is a need to further constrain the HIP voting process such that influence in vote cannot be "bought" by holding large balances
in wallets; in order to have input in the governance of the Helium network, it must be taken into consideration the "stake" a given actor
has in the network.

# Stakeholders

-Hotspot Owners
-Validators
-Routers / Console Operators / Service Companies

Voting would be limited to only the entities defined by this proposal. Voting will be constrained to any entities / network participants that are
defined as "contributing network utility". This means that only any entities that are involved in operating the network itself (transmitting / receiving data, routing data, validating PoC receipts / securing the network) are governed by and therefore have "stake" in voting on changes to the network.

It may be later concluded that only affected part(ies) should be able to vote in any given HIP, however it could potentially be problematic to enter
a territory where it becomes a matter of subjective debate whether or not a given "class" of entity is affected or not -- especially so when there are
any kind of conflicting interests or perceived loss/gain of power by one group or another. Therefore, it is currently the opinion of the author that
whatever weights are ultimately assigned are consistent across each proposed HIP.

# Detailed Explanation

Ideally voting should at a minimum use a 1:1 correlation between participant stake in the network (i.e. each hotspot purchased / onboarded,
validator staked, router loaded w/ DC).

HIP votes originated as limited scope straw polls, typically conducted and voted upon by the most active of community members
via Discord. This was limited in scope of awareness, and lacked any "official" process, or really any way to verify the
legitimacy of each vote.

The voting mechanism has since been improved greatly in awareness and security of vote simply by implementing a
public voting location and messaging through official, vastly more visible channels (e.g. Helium app push notifications) when and where these
votes are to occur -- along with relevant context resources explaining each vote and its implications.

Using private key signatures to cast votes is also a step up in loosely connecting participation in the network via some unique identifier
(wallet address / DC burn), however there is no connection between stake in the network *utility* / infrastructure required to do so. Tying
voting power to number on onboarded hotspots, validators, and/or DC held by routers provides a fair and logical basis and "stake" in the vote,
which mirrors the voting party's stake in the network.

Initial starting point suggestions would be using hotspot onboarding stake as a basis for the following weights:

-Hotspot: 1 vote (1,055,000 DC)
-Validator: X votes, where X = DC equivalent of 10,000 HNT stake at time of staking / 1,055,000
-Router: Y votes, where Y = DC on organization console / 1,055,000)

# Drawbacks

Larger private fleets will inherently have larger weight in votes than they presently do, which has a perception of "big money" controlling the vote.
This is, however, no worse off than the present method of tying HNT balance to vote weight.

# Deployment Impact

Voting mechanism should not fundamentally change in terms of how one goes about voting. The key distinction is that the hotspot count on each
a voting wallet is what is taken into consideration for vote weight as opposed to simply allowing any wallet(s) to burn DC to cast votes.

# Success Metrics

With successful implementation it should be possible to audit any given HIP vote and see that votes are proportionate to wallets' number of
eligible onboarded hotspots. It should possibly (in lieu of privacy concerns or other controversy arising in the discussion of the proposal)
also be possible to see how wallet(s) and/or hotspot(s) voted on a given HIP.
