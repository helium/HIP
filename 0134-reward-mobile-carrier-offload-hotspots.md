## Summary

This proposal outlines measures to reward and incentivize Hotspots for adding utility to the MOBILE network through participation in Carrier Offload.

## Related Prior HIPs

- [HIP 131](./0131-bridging-gap-between-verification-mappers-and-anti-gaming-measures.md): Created anti-gaming measures for the MOBILE network
- [HIP 103](./0103-oracle-hex-boosting.md): Created MOBILE Oracle Hex Boosting.
- [HIP 118](./0118-verification-mapping.md): Created Verification Mapping for MOBILE Network.

## Motivation

Helium Mobile, the first Service Provider on the MOBILE network, is currently in active Carrier Offload with Tier-1 mobile network operators (MNOs) to provide Carrier Wi-Fi offload services.

Currently, >1,000 Hotspots are participating in Carrier Offload transferring >2 terabytes per day across >8,000 subscribers per day.  A significant amount of the data transferred is paid data resulting in HNT token burn.

Although these Hotspots are providing significant utility to the network, they arenâ€™t necessarily fully rewarded due to requirements from previously approved Helium-Improvement-Proposals (HIPs) such as HIP 131, 103, 118, and 84 or future location estimate based Proof-of-Coverage (PoC) HIPS such as 133.

This HIP aims to commensurately reward those Hotspots for the utility they are providing the Helium ecosystem.  As a side benefit, this HIP may increase the incentives to deploy Hotspots for Carrier Offload.

This HIP does not intend to drastically alter the current rewards frameworks for the MOBILE network.  This will likely be addressed in future HIPs where PoC rewards shift from modeled coverage to a more utility based model.

## Stakeholders

* Deployers: This rewards and increases the incentives to deploy Hotspots into high value locations that add utility to the MOBILE network
* Service Providers: This increases the coverage for the carriers participating in Carrier Offload

## Detailed Explanation

Proposed Incentives for Hotspot Deployers

This HIP proposes two incentives for Hotspot deployers if they meet the requirements detailed further below:

1. **Qualified Hotspots** earn full PoC rewards regardless of whether they have a call detail record (CDR) or verification mapping event from a discovery mapper.  For example, a qualified Hotspot would not have to meet the requirements of HIP 131, HIP 133, or similiar location based HIPs to earn full PoC.  Applies to outdoor and indoor wifi hotspots.

2. **Qualified Hotspots** will automatically have an Oracle Multiplier of 1.00X regardless of its original multiplier.  Applies to outdoor and indoor wifi hotspots.

Hotspots meeting the requirement below will be considered qualified for the purposes of this HIP:

- A Hotspot serving >25 unique connections, as defined by the Carrier utlizing the hotspots for Carrier Offload, on a seven day rolling average.

Notes: 
- Data-only hotspots, as defined by HIP 130, are out of scope for this HIP as they do not qualify for proof-of-coverage (PoC) rewards
- 50% of participating hotspots would meet the 25 unique connection requirements according to Nova Labs during the October 3, 2024 Mobile Working Group (MWG) call.
- "Full PoC" refers to all rewards coming from the PoC rewards bucket including boosted rewards.

## Drawbacks

Some Hotspots may not be selected for Carrier Offload.  However, there are other ways to qualify for PoC rewards as described in HIPs such as 131 and 118.

## Rationale and Alternatives

This is intended to be a simple HIP that does not drastically alter the current rewards frameworks for the MOBILE network.

The number of unique connections and other utility centric requirements (e.g. data transfer metrics) could be add and scaled higher over time as higher performing Hotspots participate in the Carrier Offload.

## Deployment Impact

MOBILE Oracles will report tagging of Hotspots as qualified so they earn full PoC.  This data will be shared in a way that community applications can allow a deployer to understand they met the requirements of this HIP.

This will HIP will require code changesa and Nova Labs has agreed to implement them if approved by the community.  Changes were described as "relatively" straigh forward.

## Success Metrics

This HIP will be considered a success if deployers adding utility earn full PoC rewards.

In addition, this HIP aims to incentivize a 50% increase in the amount of paid data across the network 6 months after implementation.
