## Summary

Currently, voters are able to deceive the community by voting the opposite of what they intend to vote, then changing their vote as the voting period ends. This is deceptive and should be prohibited. This HIP will allow only one vote per HIP, nullifying the ability to deceive the community duing the voting period of each HIP.

## Motivation

After observing and participating in the voting of HIP 101, it became apparent that one or more voters "flipped" their votes from "against" to "for" this particular HIP, to the tune of multiple billions of votes.

## Stakeholders

Everyone in the Helium ecosystem.

## Drawbacks

None.

## Rationale and Alternatives

The ability to change one's vote all the way up to the closing date/time of the vote allows for potential manipulation. This potential vote manipulation is unethical, inexusable, and must be prevented on all future HIPs. This HIP will ensure that everyone's vote is truthful, as they will only have one chance to vote. All other voting priviledges, such as locking up more tokens, etc. will continue as-is.
