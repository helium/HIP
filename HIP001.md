# Summary
[summary]: #summary

This RFC attempts to describe an on-chain governance mechanism that relies on a voting mechanism in conjuction with _chain variables_ to effect changes to the blockchain network.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

We must decide on a mechanism for the on-going governance of the blockchain network. For clarities sake, _governance_ refers to changes to consensnus breaking rules. These could be changes to the minting schedule, mining reward distribution, or the number of consensus members required.

The goal is for Helium Inc to not be the sole governor of the network. This helps with a variety of issues such as increasing user and enterprise adoption, all the way through to securities law analysis.

# Detailed Explanation
[detailed-explanation]: #detailed-explanation

Today, we have a number of _chain variables_ that allow various network rules to be changed. These variables can be changed by submitting a _blockchain_txn_vars_ transaction signed by a master key. A list of chain variables and their detailed descriptions is below.

The master key is secured in cold storage by Helium Inc.

## Governance Mechanism

I propose that the correct mechanism for deploying a _blockchain_txn_vars_ is by on-chain vote of network stakeholders.

### Governance Stakeholders

The appropriate stakeholders for governance voting are as follows, with votes weighted accordingly:

- Security Token holders (100:1)

- Hotspot hosts (1:1)

- OUI owners (Based on DC usage)

Hotspot hosts will have to have a _score_ above a minimum threshold before they can be considered for a given vote.

This allows all the appropriate constituents of the network - investors, hotspot hosts, and end users - to participate in governance voting. Becoming a Security Token holder, Hotspot host, or OUI owner required $ investment in the network.

### Voting

Voting should take place on-chain, not through an out of band mechanism. Any _stakeholder_ should be able to create and sign a _voting transaction_ at any time which proposes which chain variable to change and to what new value.

Each voting transaction requires a minimum affirmative threshold of stakeholders in order to pass, and by default fails to pass after a certain number of blocks. These values are also defined as chain variables.

Stakeholders vote by signing a transaction including the hash of the original voting transaction and a boolean value, affirmative or negative, and submitting it to the network . If the minimum affirmative threshold is met, a _blockchain_txn_vars_ transaction with the updated chain variable value is submitted to the blockchain and the change is effected.

## New Code & Features

If new code is introduced which adds features outside the scope of the existing chain variables, a new chain variable should accompany the feature. That chain variable should set the default value to false or zero, until a vote occurs that changes this value effectively enabling the new feature.

For example, if it was desired to add a feature which allowed HLM holders to "lock" their coins and receive 5% of the mining rewards for that epoch, the following changes would be needed:

- the code for a new transaction type that locks coins would be required

- a new chain variable (initially set at 0%) would be required that included a distribution to locked coins

- a vote would be required to specify the distribution amount

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Introducing a (relatively) democratic governance system like this has several challenges:

- Governance Stakeholders need to understand the impact of changes they are voting on

- Uninformed voters may make irrational decisions which impact the quality and stability of the network

Additionally, there is engineering complexity in developing an on-chain mechanism and the security implications will need to be thoroughly vetted, although we largely suffer from this risk with our current system.

# Rationale and Alternatives
[alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

This is your chance to discuss your proposal in the context of the whole design
space. This is probably the most important section!

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?

- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not
  choosing them?

- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved Questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

- what is the correct weighting of stakeholders?

- should OUI holders be weighted by aggregate amount of DC spent so this isn't an easy attack vector?

- how do new chain vars get added and decided upon?

- what is the correct way to submit voting transactions?

- how does the chain variable master key become decentralized over all stakeholders? m of n mulitisg? SSS? something else?

- how is the eventual chain var transaction signed and submitted once the vote is over?

- should the reward percentages be a single data structure that has to add up to 1 (or 100%) to be valid, such that the distribution percentages can't be voted over or under 100% in total?

# Deployment Impact
[deployment-impact]: #deployment-impact

Describe how this design will be deployed and any potential imapact it may have on
current users of this project.

- How will current users be impacted?

- How will existing documentation/knowlegebase need to be supported?

- Is this backwards compatible?

- If not, what is the procedure to migrate?

# Success Metrics
[success-metrics]: #success-metrics

What metrics can be used to measure the success of this design?

- What should we measure to prove a performance increase?

- What should we measure to prove an improvement in stability?

- What should we measure to prove a reduction in complexity?

- What should we measure to prove an acceptance of this by it's users?
