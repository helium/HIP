# Summary
[summary]: #summary

The proposed change of frequency plan for Australia has highlighted some major deficiencies on how the DEWI LoRaWAN committee is being selected and how it has been governed.

This HIP suggests a number of improvements in the following areas
1. Selection of members
2. Declaration of conflict of interest
3. Governance procedures
4. Ethics guidelines
5. Process of including the affected regions in the decision-making process

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Wide-ranging (technical) changes that affect whole countries and regions should never be decided without informed debate and input from the region(s) which will have to live with the effects of such decisions. Proper governance procedures are required to ensure that due care is taken making such decisions.

# Stakeholders
[stakeholders]: #stakeholders

There are two (2) stakeholder groups with this HIP:
 - DEWI LoRaWAN Committee
    - A clear governance structure will support the DEWI LoRaWAN committee to ensure strong, objective, sustainable and inclusive growth, without bias and conflict.
 - Wider Helium Ecosystem
    - Without a clear articulated governance structure decisions made will inadvertedly create unintended consequeces. Such decisions without adequate consultation have the potential to create critical user issues and harm growth, which is the reason why selection and governance of this committee are so crucial.


## Community and stakeholder engagement
We are reaching out to members
 - Github repository feedback
 - Helium Community HIP Discord channel
 - Other relevant Helium Community Discord channels.

# Detailed Explanation
[detailed-explanation]: #detailed-explanation


## Guiding principles of the committee
The committee has a responsiblity too:
 - operate in a transparent, timely and accountable manner at all times
 - communicate clearly and regularly with stakeholders and the DEWI as appropriate
 - adopt existing LoRa Alliance standards where applicable
 - act in conformance with the relevant regulatory bodies in each regionReport to wider Helium Community via meeting minutes and / or communiques on meeting outcomesReport to wider Helium Community via meeting minutes and / or communiques on meeting outcomesReport to wider Helium Community via meeting minutes and / or communiques on meeting outcomesReport to wider Helium Community via meeting minutes and / or communiques on meeting outcomes
 - endeavour to reach consensus within the committee, taking into account the views of all members.


The committee’s recommendations must:
 - not be inconsistent with LoRa Alliance standards and directives by regional regulators
 - be based on the best available scientific information, evidence based policy and encourage best practice in the Helium ecosystem
 - balance the technical implications and impacts of changes with the practicalities of operators in the wider Helium ecosystem
 - be clear, logical and verifiable
 - demonstrate that the views of affected stakeholder groups have been considered
 - aim to reduce unnecessary, ineffective or duplicative regulation.



## Membership
Committee membership is critical to the transparency and capability of the committee for effective and independent in decision making.

The committee must consist of at least:
 - an independent chair (not connected to either DEWI or Helium Inc)
 - three LoRaWAN and/or RF engineering experts, to ensure appropriate technical expertise is maintained
 - one person with a practical understanding of the operational, technical and logistical facets
 - one standards development/regulation specialist.

 The committee should engage other external experts and participants invited by the chair as required and determined by the agenda.
 The committee has the opportunity to establish working groups (may be topic or region specific) to provide advice the committee.



## Eligibility requirements and declarations of personal interests (conflicts of interest)
Each member is required to make a declaration confirming they met the eligibility requirements upon their appointment to the committee. As part of each contract, members must continue to comply with eligibility requirements.

During the operation of the committee, members are to declare to the chair all known actual or potential conflicts of interest as soon as they become aware of the conflict. Each meeting should contain a standard agenda item to allow for actual and percieved acknowledgement.

The initial declaration of eligibility made to the DEWI prior to joining the committee and subsequent statements of personal interest will be deemed to be a ‘standing statement’ for all meetings of the committee.

At each meeting, members are to advise of any new actual or potential conflicts of interest arising in respect of issues on the meeting agenda. These should be recorded in the minutes of the meeting,
along with the course of action taken in relation to managing the conflict of interest.
Where a conflict of interest is declared by a member on a particular agenda item, the chair and remaining committee members are to consider the nature and extent of the conflict and adopt one of
the following courses of action:
 - allow the member to participate in discussion and in decision-making on the matter
 - allow the member to be involved in discussions on the matter but not be involved in making a decision in relation to the matter
 - exclude the member from participation in any discussion or decision-making on the matter
 - direct the member to leave the meeting during deliberation on the matter.


The use of external experts is also subject to conflict of interest considerations. Each potential external expert must declare any potential conflict of interest or any possible perception of bias that could prevent him or her from participating in the review of a particular issue/standard. If this declaration raises concerns about whether the external expert should participate in the review, the chair may nominate an alternative expert.

## Technical Advisory Committee Operational Guidelines
### Committee roles and responsibilities
The committee structure has been designed to balance the skills, interests and expertise of its members so that the group may offer sound advice to DEWI.

All members are responsible for:
 - remaining fundamentally committed to the improvement of the Helium ecosystem
 - operating in a transparent, timely and accountable manner
 - ensuring all technical issues, new research and scientific knowledge submitted by stakeholders relating to technical matters have been properly considered by the committee and independent expert
advice sought as necessary
 - contributing to the development of clear timelines and work plans for the committee
 - ensuring all interested stakeholders have the opportunity to provide review input
 - clearly analysing the benefits and costs of the proposed options for affected stakeholders in a balanced and objective manner.

The independent chair is expected to:
 - chair meetings, including:
   - advising the committee about meeting protocols
   - reminding committee members that they are bound by confidentiality provisions
   - managing declarations of conflict of interest
   - facilitate constructive processes that allow for continuous improvement DEWI and the Helium ecosystem overall
   - ensure work of the committee is conducted efficiently and that recommendations are presented to DEWI within agreed timelines
   - ensure committee members act in accordance with the guiding principles of the terms of reference in all aspects of operations
 - ensure the committee undertakes appropriate record keeping of decisions and actions
 - provide final approval of committee meeting papers and recommendations
 - provide progress updates and reporting to DEWI.
 - report to wider Helium community via meeting minutes and / or communiques on meeting outcomes

## Reporting arrangements
The committee, through the chair, will report to DEWI. In addition to their final recommendations the committee will provide a report that outlines their consultation process, issues raised by stakeholders and their deliberations in reaching their recommendations to DEWI.

The information shall be published on DEWI's website or Github repository. This information published will include information outlining the issues for consideration, the consultation timelines and updates on progress of the review. Submissions (unless clearly marked ‘IN CONFIDENCE’) and draft and final recommendations
will also be published on these pages.


# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

None.

The Helium ecosystem can not afford the fact that important governance procedures are not in existence at DEWI and their related committees.

# Rationale and Alternatives
[alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?

No other proposals are currently available. Widest possible community feedback will be sought to consider in this proposal.

Best practice governance provides strong platform for growth and sustainablity

- What is the impact of not doing this?

Poor decision making and unneccesary disruption of the ecosystem due to such decisions. Regional disruptions and potential disconnect 

# Unresolved Questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

- How does this governance proposal for the LoRaWAN committee fit in with an overall DEWI governance structure

- Do any decisions made by the LoRaWAN committee prior to the approval of this HIP need to be reviewed? Details of existing documentation has been sought.


What related issues do you consider out of scope for this HIP that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this HIP?

-[TODO]

# Deployment Impact
[deployment-impact]: #deployment-impact

There is no deployment impact. This HIP purely describes poper governance and procedures in the decision making process

It will create a proper governance structure ensuring that decisions are made with proper consideration of all stakeholders and ensures that conflicts of interest have to be declared.

Documentation on this process should be made available via Helium Docs

There are no backwards compatibility issues. The only potential issue is how to deal with decisions made prior to this change in governance.


# Success Metrics
[success-metrics]: #success-metrics

What metrics can be used to measure the success of this design?

- Faith of current Helium investors in regions
- Engagement by community in future decisions
- Alignment to best practice and possibility to lead by example
