# Summary
[summary]: #summary

The proposed change of frequency plan for Australia has highlighted some major deficiencies on how the DEWI LoRaWAN committee is being selected and how it has been governed.

This HIP suggests a number of improvements in the following areas
1. Selection of members - improving diversity
2. Declaration of conflict of interest
3. Governance procedures
4. Ethics guidelines
5. Process of including the affected regions in the decision-making process

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Changes that affect whole countries and regions should never be decided without input from the region which will have to live with the effects of such a decision.

# Stakeholders
[stakeholders]: #stakeholders

The only body directly affected by this HIP is the DEWI LoRaWAN committee.
However, the wider Helium ecosystem will be affected indirectly by decisions made in this committee. 
Which is the reason why selection and governance of this committee are so crucial.

* Community and stakeholder engagement
We are reaching out to members
  they may not be watching the HIPs repository or even aren't directly active in
  the Helium Community Slack channels.

# Detailed Explanation
[detailed-explanation]: #detailed-explanation

- Introduce and explain new concepts.

- It should be reasonably clear how the proposal would be implemented.

- Provide representative examples that show how this proposal would be commonly
  used.

- Corner cases should be dissected by example.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

- Why should we *not* do this?

# Rationale and Alternatives
[alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

This is your chance to discuss your proposal in the context of the whole design
space. This is probably the most important section!

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?

- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not
  choosing them?

- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved Questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

Do any decisions made by the LoRaWAN committee prior to the approval of this HIP need to be reviewed?



- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this HIP that could be
  addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this
  HIP?

# Deployment Impact
[deployment-impact]: #deployment-impact

There is no deployment impact. This HIP purely describes poper governance and procedures in the decision making process

It will improve the 

Documentation on this process should be made available via Helium Docs

There are no backwards compatibility issues. The only potential issue is how to deal with decisions made prior to this change in governance.


# Success Metrics
[success-metrics]: #success-metrics

What metrics can be used to measure the success of this design?

- What should we measure to prove a performance increase?

- What should we measure to prove an improvement in stability?

- What should we measure to prove a reduction in complexity?

- What should we measure to prove an acceptance of this by it's users?
