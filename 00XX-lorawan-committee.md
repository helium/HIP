# Summary
[summary]: #summary

The proposed change of frequency plan for Australia has highlighted some major deficiencies on how the DEWI LoRaWAN committee is being selected and how it has been governed.

This HIP suggests a number of improvements in the following areas
1. Selection of members - improving diversity
2. Declaration of conflict of interest
3. Governance procedures
4. Ethics guidelines
5. Process of including the affected regions in the decision-making process

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Changes that affect whole countries and regions should never be decided without input from the region which will have to live with the effects of such a decision.

# Stakeholders
[stakeholders]: #stakeholders

The only body directly affected by this HIP is the DEWI LoRaWAN committee.
However, the wider Helium ecosystem will be affected indirectly by decisions made in this committee. 
Which is the reason why selection and governance of this committee are so crucial.

* Community and stakeholder engagement
We are reaching out to members
  they may not be watching the HIPs repository or even aren't directly active in
  the Helium Community Slack channels.

# Detailed Explanation
[detailed-explanation]: #detailed-explanation


## Guiding principles of the committee
The committee will:
 - operate in a transparent, timely and accountable manner at all times
 - communicate clearly and regularly with stakeholders and the DEWI as appropriate
 - adopt existing LoRa Alliance standards where applicable
 - endeavour to reach consensus within the committee, taking into account the views of all members.


The committee’s recommendations must:
 - not be inconsistent with LoRa Alliance standards and directives
 - be based on the best available scientific information, evidence based policy and encourage best practice in the Helium ecosystem
 - balance the technical implications and impacts of changes with the practicalities of operators in the wider Helium ecosystem
 - be clear, logical and verifiable
 - demonstrate that the views of affected stakeholder groups have been considered
 - aim to reduce unnecessary, ineffective or duplicative regulation.



## Membership
The committee must consist of at least:
 - an independent chair (not connected to either DEWI or Helium Inc)
 - three LoRaWAN and/or RF engineering experts, to ensure appropriate technical expertise is maintained
species issues
 - one person with a practical understanding of the operational, technical and logistical facets
 - one standards development/regulation specialist.

Other external experts and participants may be invited by the chair to discuss particular agenda items.


## Eligibility requirements and declarations of personal interests (conflicts of interest)
Each member is required to make a declaration confirming they met the eligibility requirements upon their appointment to the committee. As part of each contract, members must continue to comply with the
eligibility requirements.
During the operation of the committee, members are to declare to the chair all known actual or potential conflicts of interest as soon as they become aware of the conflict. The initial declaration of eligibility made to the DEWI prior to joining the committee and subsequent statements of personal interest will be deemed to be a ‘standing statement’ for all meetings of the committee.
At each meeting, members are to advise of any new actual or potential conflicts of interest arising in respect of issues on the meeting agenda. These should be recorded in the minutes of the meeting,
along with the course of action taken in relation to managing the conflict of interest.
Where a conflict of interest is declared by a member on a particular agenda item, the chair and remaining committee members are to consider the nature and extent of the conflict and adopt one of
the following courses of action:
 - allow the member to participate in discussion and in decision-making on the matter
 - allow the member to be involved in discussions on the matter but not be involved in making a decision in relation to the matter
 - exclude the member from participation in any discussion or decision-making on the matter
 - direct the member to leave the meeting during deliberation on the matter.


The use of external experts is also subject to conflict of interest considerations. Each potential external expert must declare any potential conflict of interest or any possible perception of bias that could prevent him or her from participating in the review of a particular issue/standard. If this declaration raises concerns about whether the external expert should participate in the review, the chair may nominate an alternative expert.

## Technical Advisory Committee Operational Guidelines
### Committee roles and responsibilities
The committee structure has been designed to balance the skills, interests and expertise of its members so that the group may offer sound advice to DEWI.

All members are responsible for:
 - remaining fundamentally committed to the improvement of the Helium ecosystem
 - operating in a transparent, timely and accountable manner
 - ensuring all technical issues, new research and scientific knowledge submitted by stakeholders relating to technical matters have been properly considered by the committee and independent expert
advice sought as necessary
 - contributing to the development of clear timelines and work plans for the committee
 - ensuring all interested stakeholders have the opportunity to provide review input
 - clearly analysing the benefits and costs of the proposed options for affected stakeholders in a balanced and objective manner.

The independent chair is expected to:
 - chair meetings, including:
   - advising the committee about meeting protocols
   - reminding committee members that they are bound by confidentiality provisions
   - managing declarations of conflict of interest
   - facilitate constructive processes that allow for continuous improvement DEWI and the Helium ecosystem overall
   - ensure work of the committee is conducted efficiently and that recommendations are presented to DEWI within agreed timelines
   - ensure committee members act in accordance with the guiding principles of the terms of reference in all aspects of operations
 - ensure the committee undertakes appropriate record keeping of decisions and actions
 - provide final approval of committee meeting papers and recommendations
 - provide progress updates and reporting to DEWI.

## Reporting arrangements
The committee, through the chair, will report to DEWI. In addition to their final recommendations the committee will provide a report that outlines their consultation process, issues raised by stakeholders and their deliberations in reaching their recommendations to DEWI.

The information shall be published on DEWI's website or Github repository. This information published will include information outlining the issues for consideration, the consultation timelines and updates on progress of the review. Submissions (unless clearly marked ‘IN CONFIDENCE’) and draft and final recommendations
will also be published on these pages.


# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

None.

The Helium ecosystem can not afford the fact that important governance procedures are not in existence at DEWI and their related committees.

# Rationale and Alternatives
[alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

This is your chance to discuss your proposal in the context of the whole design
space. This is probably the most important section!

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?

- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not
  choosing them?

- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved Questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

Do any decisions made by the LoRaWAN committee prior to the approval of this HIP need to be reviewed?



- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this HIP that could be
  addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this
  HIP?

# Deployment Impact
[deployment-impact]: #deployment-impact

There is no deployment impact. This HIP purely describes poper governance and procedures in the decision making process

It will improve the 

Documentation on this process should be made available via Helium Docs

There are no backwards compatibility issues. The only potential issue is how to deal with decisions made prior to this change in governance.


# Success Metrics
[success-metrics]: #success-metrics

What metrics can be used to measure the success of this design?

- What should we measure to prove a performance increase?

- What should we measure to prove an improvement in stability?

- What should we measure to prove a reduction in complexity?

- What should we measure to prove an acceptance of this by it's users?
