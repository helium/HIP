## Introduction:
The Helium network is a decentralized network that relies on hotspots to create and maintain the network. However, in some cases, the rewards of some hotspots may be denied due to potential fraudulent activity. While it is important to prevent fraud, it may also result in the unfair denial of rewards to legitimate hotspots.

## Proposal:
To address this issue, this HIP proposes a temporary holding of rewards for hotspots that have been placed on the denied list. The rewards would be held until a review and appeal process is completed. If the hotspot is deemed to be legitimate, the rewards would be returned to the hotspot owner.

## Implementation:
1. A review and appeal process will be established to allow hotspot owners to challenge their denied rewards.
2. The rewards for denied hotspots will be temporarily held in a secure escrow account.
3. The review and appeal process will be conducted by a panel of experts in the Helium community.
4. The panel will review the evidence presented by the hotspot owner and make a determination on the legitimacy of the hotspot.
5. If the hotspot is deemed to be legitimate, the rewards will be returned to the hotspot owner.

## Conclusion:
This HIP aims to prevent the unfair denial of rewards to legitimate hotspots while also maintaining the integrity of the Helium network. By temporarily holding the rewards until a review and appeal process is completed, we can ensure that the network is protected against fraud while also ensuring that the rewards are fairly distributed to those who have contributed to the network.
