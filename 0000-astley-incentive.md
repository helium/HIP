## Summary

One paragraph explanation of the proposal.

Inspired by the 1987 debut single "Never Gonna Give You Up" this proposal intends to continue teh legacy of Richard Astley's pursuit of upward progress. Hotspots are not stangers and know the rules with a full commitment not presented in any other network. This proposal intends to ensure the Network is unable to give up, let connectivity down, run out of capacity, make sensor builders cry, nor say goodbye to the Hotspot Operators whom do not lie nor hurt the Peope's Network.

## Motivation

- Never gonna give the People's Network up
- Never gonna let the People's Network down
- Never gonna run around and desert the People's Network
- Never gonna make the People's Network cry
- Never gonna say goodbye to the People's Network
- Never gonna tell a lie and hurt the People's Network

## Stakeholders

- Who is affected by this HIP? A stakeholder is any individual, group, or party such as network
  users, Hotspot hosts, or token holders.
- How are we soliciting feedback on this HIP from these stakeholders? Note that they may not be
  watching the HIP repository or even directly active in the Helium Community chat channels.

## Detailed Explanation

- Introduce and explain new concepts.
- It should be reasonably clear how the proposal would be implemented.
- Provide representative examples that show how this proposal would be commonly used.
- Corner cases should be dissected by example.

## Drawbacks

- Why should we _not_ do this?
- What problems could occur if we do this?

## Rationale and Alternatives

This is your chance to discuss your proposal in the context of the whole design space. This is
probably the most important section!

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

## Unresolved Questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the HIP process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this HIP that could be addressed in the
  future independently of the solution that comes out of this HIP?
- Are there dependencies, milestones, or dates that need to be met for this HIP to succeed?

## Deployment Impact

Describe how this design will be deployed and any potential impact it may have on current users of
this project.

- How will current users be impacted?
- How will existing documentation/knowledge base need to be supported? Any content to change at
  <http://docs.helium.com>?
- Is this backwards compatible? Can this HIP be undone?
  - If not, what is the procedure to migrate?

## Success Metrics

What metrics can be used to measure the success of this design? Are any new ETL reports needed to
measure the success?

- What should we measure to prove a performance increase?
- What should we measure to prove an improvement in stability?
- What should we measure to prove a reduction in complexity?
- What should we measure to prove an acceptance of this by its users?
