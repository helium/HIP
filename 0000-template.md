# Detailed Explanation

- Introduce and explain new concepts.

- It should be reasonably clear how the proposal would be implemented.

- Provide representative examples that show how this proposal would be commonly
  used.

- Corner cases should be dissected by example.

# Drawbacks

- Why should we *not* do this?
- What problems could occur if we do this?

# Rationale and Alternatives

This is your chance to discuss your proposal in the context of the whole design
space. This is probably the most important section!

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?

- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not
  choosing them?

- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved Questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the HIP process
  before this gets merged?

  addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this
  HIP?

- Are there are dependencies, milestones or dates that need need to be met for
  this HIP to succeed?

- How will current users be impacted?

- How will existing documentation/knowlegebase need to be supported?
  Any content to change at <http://docs.helium.com> ?

- Is this backwards compatible?
  Can this HIP be undone?

        - If not, what is the procedure to migrate?

# Success Metrics

What metrics can be used to measure the success of this design?
Are any new ETL reports needed to measure the success?

- What should we measure to prove a performance increase?
