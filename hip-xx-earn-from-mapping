# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Enable Lorawan coverage mappers to earn, in the same spirit as proposed plans for 5g PoC (witness events being based off a phone app)

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Mappers has always been a volunteer program because of complexities with trusting the data. Currently anyone can submit data to the mappers system so it cannot be trusted. 

5G PoC calls for Proof of Coverage that includes witnessing being done by mobile phones, and that it is vital to prove coverage for companies to move over. My belief is this same requirement is needed for LoRaWan coverage.

# Detailed Explanation

The LR1110 chipset is in suggestion for a method of proving hostspots in the wild, and at the same time, this could be used for trusted mapping data.

The LR1110 contains a Cryptographic engine that has:

Hardware support for AES-128 encryption/decryption based algorithms
Handling device parameters such as DevEUI and JoinEUI, as defined by the LoRa Alliance
Protects confidential information such as encryption keys against unauthorized access
Stores NwkKey, AppKey, as defined in the LoRaWAN standard

It also includes WIFI sniffing, so when a GNSS location cannot be found, WIFI sniffing can be performed to work out location.

A development kit of this can be purchased for as little as £70, with the lr1110 chipset itself costing £10.

I Propose via a hip19 style aproval process, that manufacturers can submit designs of this chipset and onboard mappers. 

5G PoC calls for a 9% share of the pool, of which 5.35% goes to phones for witnessing. This works out to around 12,000HNT per month, 0.48% of monthly supply. 

This is to be reduced from the DC pool, taken from the spillover from overages in DC to witnessing

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

- Why should we *not* do this?

# Rationale and Alternatives
[alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

This is your chance to discuss your proposal in the context of the whole design
space. This is probably the most important section!

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?

- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not
  choosing them?

- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved Questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the HIP process
  before this gets merged?

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation
  of this feature?

- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this HIP that could be
  addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this
  HIP?

# Deployment Impact
[deployment-impact]: #deployment-impact

Describe how this design will be deployed and any potential impact it may have on
current users of this project.

- How will current users be impacted?

- How will existing documentation/knowlegebase need to be supported?

- Is this backwards compatible?

        - If not, what is the procedure to migrate?

# Success Metrics
[success-metrics]: #success-metrics

What metrics can be used to measure the success of this design?

- What should we measure to prove a performance increase?

- What should we measure to prove an improvement in stability?

- What should we measure to prove a reduction in complexity?

- What should we measure to prove an acceptance of this by it's users?
