# HIP 72: Secure Concentrators

 * Author(s) @Dinocore
 * Start Date: Oct 1, 2022
 * Category: Technical
 * Original HIP PR: #484
 * Tracking Issue: #489

## Summary
In this HIP, we propose a new type of IoT network actor: the Secure Concentrator Card (SCC). Secure Concentrator Card is similar to standard LoRaWAN concentrator cards, but with additional Secure Microcontroller Unit (SMCU) and onboard GPS receiver. The SMCU digitally signs LoRa data packets as they are received from the radio. In this way, packet data and its corresponding metadata (RSSI, Frequency, GPS location and time) can be verified to be authentic.

## Motivation
Today's Helium Hotspot have a large security flaw. Anyone can modify the software running on a hotspot and generate fake LoRa packets. This is a big problem because PoC rewards are based on these packets. The new Secure Concentrator Card solves this problem by digitally signing packets in hardware. Secure Concentrators make it *prohibitively* difficult to game the PoC system by also utilizing tamper-resistant design elements (routed traces, hard cured potting material, etc). The end result is a more secure Physical Root of Trust for the Helium IoT system and fair PoC earnings for all.

The proposed SCC design allows existing Helium miners to upgrade by swapping out existing concentrator cards with new secure card. In addition, SCC would enable the DIY community to build their own hardware, greatly increasing the diversity and proliferation of hotspots.

## Stakeholders

The entire IoT Helium network will be affected by this HIP as the introduction of SCC will make gaming the network very difficult to perform and scalable.

## Detailed Explanation

### Design Goals

 * Increase security level of Helium's Proof-of-Coverage (I.E. make gaming much more difficult).
 * Ability to replace/upgrade existing Miner's concentrator card with secure concentrator card
 * Turn off-the-shelf LoRaWAN gateways into full PoC Helium miner (DIY hotspot)
   * Secure Concentrators effectively replace the need for ECC806 security chip as mandated in HIP 19.
 * Enable new class of Helium nodes that can provide additional functionality (LoRa PoC Mapper? Mobile Hotspot?)
 * Enable new level of Proof-of-Coverage verification (possibly using Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA)) 

### Hardware Architecture
![image ](secure-concentrators/hardware_block.png)
The new hardware architecture for SCC is based on Semtech's LoRa Corecell Gateway reference design. The major change involves the addition of a Secure MCU (**SMCU**) placed in between the communication path of the Host CPU and the SX1303. The SMCU's primary job is to cryptographically sign RF data received over the air such that other nodes participating on the Helium network are able to verify the data is authentic and unaltered from it original form. It is important the SMCU has exclusive access SX1303's SPI bus to eliminate the possibility of spoofing incoming RF packets. The hardware design will consider several techniques to make it physically difficult to access the SMPU and SX130x including using buried traces, placing the components under a metal shield, and/or using potting material.

### Hardware Key
The SMCU stores a unique ED25519 keypair generated at manufacturing time in its non-volatile memory known as the **Hardware Key**. Note: the Hardware Key is not the same as the `swarm_key`. This is an important concept as it allows existing Miner's to upgrade their existing concentrator card with new SCC. The Hardware's private key is considered a secret and stored in a special section of the SMCU non-volatile memory used for secure storage. Secure storage can not be read-out and is not accessible to the Host CPU or via hardware debugging tools.

The Hardware Key can also be used to sign other types of transactions beyond RF data. However, it does not allow signing *arbitrary* data. Doing so would put the security on par with existing HIP-19 secure element approach and thus defeat the purpose of this HIP. Note: If the SMCU's firmware allowed for signing arbitrary data with its Hardware Key, an attacker could jailbreak the Host CPU and craft a signing request that contained fake RF data.

### Semtech SX1303
The Semtech SX1303 is a new generation of LoRa baseband processor for gateways. It is size and pin compatible with SX1302 and like SX1302, it excels in cutting down current consumption, simplifying thermal design, lowering Bill Of Materials cost, and reducing overall size of gateways. In addition to supporting all the features of SX1302, SX1303 introduces a new Fine Timestamp capability that enables Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) network-based geolocation. The new TDOA feature could potentially enable another layer of Proof of Coverage. For example, Helium hotspots using SX1303 chipset could coordinate together to assert that another Helium hotspot's beacon signal actually originated from the stated geo-location.

### GPS Receiver
The GPS receiver is a required component. GPS provides geolocation and timestampling of every received packet. GPS is also needed to provide precise timing required for the Semtech SX1303 TDOA feature.

### RF Data Signature

![image ](secure-concentrators/rf_signing.png)

Semtech's open-source LoRa packet forwarder is traditionally the software that runs on the Host CPU and reads data from the SX130x hardware via SPI or USB. The packet forwarder produces output JSON formatted data when RF data is received. We propose modifying the packet forwarder software to include an additional key/value pair containing the RF data cryptographic signature.

```

### Sign Non-RF data
The SMCU can also sign non-RF data with its Hardware Key upon request. The signature will always include the string prefix `nonrf` in its message creation to distinguish from RF data.

```
payload_hash = sha512(payload | int32_msb(payload size))
msg = 'nonrf' | payload_hash | int32_msb(tmst)
signature = ed25519_sign(msg, pubKey, privKey)
```

## Secure Firmware
The firmware running on Secure Concentrator is open-source. The firmware itself has a bootloader that checks the cryptographic signature of the application image at each power up to ensure it is unaltered from its original form. The Helium Foundation manages the cryptographic key used by bootloader. The Helium Foundation is also responsible for auditing the firmware.

## Proof of Coverage Rewards
In order to incentivize adoption of Secure Concentrators, we propose increasing the earnings of PoC Witness packets received by Secure Concentrator by a factor of **(1.25x)**. We believe this is justified due to the increased security benefits the entire Helium network will enjoy with the addition of Secure Concentators.

## Onboarding
Manufacturers will purchase unique ED25519 keypairs for installation onto Secure Concentrator devices from the Heilum Foundation for a fee of 4,000,000 DC ($40 USD) each. Each Manufacturer will be required to purchase a minimum quantity of 1000 key pairs. This rule serves as a type of proof-of-stake mechanism ensuring only serious manufactures are allowed access to keypairs. Keypairs are intended for installation on Secure Concentrators produced by that Manufacturer only. Any Manufacturer found to be re-selling keypairs or otherwise using them as unintended, will have their keypairs revoked. 

Helium Foundation will make publicly available the list of public keys purchased by all Manufacturers. This ensures that any 3rd party can verify PoC transactions produced by Secure Concentrators. Oracle verifier nodes will use the public key list to verify every PoC packet signed by a Secure Concentrator.

## Drawbacks

## Rationale and Alternatives

The proposed architecture of SCC is the best possible design because it cleanly and securely decouples low-level RF packet data from high-level Helium network protocol and constructs. This decoupling is important because we expect the Helium network protocol to continue to grow and evolve in the future and it would be prohibitively difficult to maintain SMCU firmware to keep up. This architecture also enables potential new class of Helium nodes that can provide additional future functionality. For example, a SCC could be used in a PoC Mapper device to securely verify coverage in remote locations. Perhaps most importantly, this architecture can be used to upgrade existing Helium miners hopefully one day eliminating wide spread network gaming.

## Unresolved Questions

## Deployment Impact

Changes to the blockchain code will need to be made and tested on the `testnet`. When ready, these changes can be merged to `mainnet` but should have no impact on existing nodes. These changes are backwards compatible. Upgrading an existing miner with new SCC should not require any action on the Hotspot owner's part.

## Success Metrics

The central thrust of this HIP is to eliminate widespread network gaming/cheating. Success will be determined by less reported network gaming.
