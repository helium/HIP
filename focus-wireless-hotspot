Focus Wireless has designed and built products that have sold many millions of SKUs in most major markets worldwide for 2 decades.

Consumer products include those branded by Teufel (Germany), Radioshack (USA), Toshiba (Global), Motorola (US/EU), Grundig (EU/ANZ), Onkyo (US/APAC), Medion (Germany), Lenco (EU/MENA) Telefunken (Global), etc.

Focus wireless has identified an application gap within existing hotspots on the market after testing numerous contemporary products.  The RF performance, although stated to be very strong is often compromised in real-world applications due to an absence of custom matching of antennas.  Focus Wireless has solved that problem.

Focus wireless devices will be aimed at users that are outside of the major cities and thus very dependent upon fully optimized RF performance.  Focus works with recognized LoRaWAN module manufacturers and specifies and designs the modules to its own custom requirements.  These custom modules are then designed into our own products.

Focus intends to supply hotspots with a range of optional antennas that have special matching modules to ensure that the stated antenna performance is actually achieved.  In testing it has been found that this approach can offer 25% to 40% improved range over existing market products.

If the Helium network is to effectively expand into the towns and villages, hotspots need to be produced that are better matched to these challenging applications.

## Product Information 
The Focus Wireless Hotspot is a light hotspot and is in the closing stages of development and DFM (design for manufacturing) is underway, tooling for the product is in progress and prototypes can be submitted at any time.

The product is intended for indoor use with optional outdoor antennas.
