# Summary
[summary]: #summary

This HIP retroactively approves and updates the base coverage points of the emergency coverage templates that were deployed by Nova Labs as a result of a likely permanent outage in the Google Network Planner API that was previously relied on for the creation of modeled coverage objects. Specifically we propose using the median value of CPs for all deployments of each radio/antenna type as the basis for these templated coverage objects.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

On 9/26/24, Nova Labs discovered an outage in the Google Network Planner service that was essential for the creation and maintenance of coverage objects. They immediately implemented a templated coverage fallback for deployments that required new or updated coverage objects. Subsequently, this templated coverage began to be deployed to all hotspots on 10/4/24. 

In parallel to this, there have been ongoing discussions regarding the adoption of universal templated coverage objects in support of the Helium Mobile Network's efforts to expand internationally and given the lack of adequate existing services to create modeled coverage objects outside the US. 

Further, because there are no current ways to enforce antenna direction and height for outdoor WiFi units (these also are difficult to enforce post-CPI for CBRS units), real world coverage may not match modeled coverage if the asserted values do not match real world conditions. 

Templated coverage objects are already utilized for outdoor WiFi units deployed in Mexico as part of the Telefonica pilot, along with all indoor WiFi and CBRS units. 

# Stakeholders
[stakeholders]: #stakeholders

Deployers: Individuals who have deployments with more coverage points than the median will likely experience a decrease in rewards while those with fewer coverage points will see an increase in rewards. Deployments with no proposed changes in coverage points (those already utilizing templated coverage) may see a slight increase in rewards due to a decrease in the total number of coverage points of all deployments. 

# Detailed Explanation
[detailed-explanation]: #detailed-explanation

On 10/4/24, Nova Labs began to roll out a templated coverage object too all hotspots on the network using the following base parameters:
Wi-Fi indoor - 400 CPs (no change)
Wi-Fi outdoor - 1000 CPs
Baicells 430 - 1428 CPs
Baicells 436 - 5570 CPs
Moso Indoor - 250 CPs (no change) 
Moso Outdoor - 504 CPs

While these numbers were primarily based on mean values across the network, two specific changes were introduced: The scaling down of CPs for WiFi outdoor units (from 2164 mean CPs to 1000 in the object) and for the Baicells 436 (from 10648 mean CPs to 5570 in the object). For Outdoor WiFi, the change was primarily driven by concerns about "height gaming" (falsely asserting an inflated height to maximize PoC earnings). This concern is born out by both real world investigations of hotspots and analysis of the distribution of coverage points across all outdoor WiFi units which shows a significant rightward skew in the data along with a large standard deviation. For the Baicells 436, the scaling was performed due to the following concern: "The 436 setups generate unusually high points, likely because users with 436 antennas optimize propagation to maximize rewards. This leads to numerous inefficient setups, such as omni and butterfly antennas, in high-reward areas."

While these are certainly legitimate concerns, they are likely beyond the scope of an emergency HIP such as this one. Therefore we propose a solely data-driven approach to creating these templated coverage objects utilizing the median values of each radio/antenna type. This also helps mitigate some concerns over gaming setups as outlier datapoints will not impact the median value. The following values are proposed:
Wi-Fi indoor - 400 CPs (no change)
Wi-Fi outdoor - 1760 CPs
Baicells 430 - 795 CPs
Moso Indoor - 250 CPs (no change) 
Moso Outdoor - 347 CPs
Baicells 436 (broken down by antenna type):
KP Performance KPPA-3GHZ-DPOMA - 10918

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

The main drawback is that this system no longer properly incentivizes deployments that provide significant coverage as all deployments of a particular radio type receive the same rewards. Unfortunately, given the current lack of data to created modeled coverage, it is unclear how to mitigate this. 

# Rationale and Alternatives
[alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

This HIP is designed for one specific purpose, to provide a purely data-driven method for determining the amount of base coverage points that should be included in these templated coverage points. While concerns over height gaming and "useless" coverage are certainly legitimate, they are beyond the scope of this emergency HIP. Ongoing discussions in the community regarding "Proof-of-Utility" metrics will also likely result in further refinements to these CP values over time. 

# Unresolved Questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

None.

# Deployment Impact
[deployment-impact]: #deployment-impact

Nova Labs will be responsible for creating these templated coverage objects and deploying them on a network-wide basis. 

        - If not, what is the procedure to migrate?

# Success Metrics
[success-metrics]: #success-metrics

Distribution of rewards aggregated by radio type after the deployment of these objects relatively closely match the distribution of rewards preceding the Network Planner API outage and the deployment of emergency templated coverage objects.
