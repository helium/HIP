## Summary
This HIP stipulates what 15 Billion of the 20 billion MOBILE currently under the Helium Foundation custody will be used for. 

## Stakeholders
MOBILE Token Owners - MOBILE token holders will benefit from the burn of MOBILE, and the addition of new service providers

Helium Foundation - The Helium Foundation will benefit from the grant of 2B MOBILE.


## Motivation

As a part of [HIP 53](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0053-mobile-dao.md), 50 Billion MOBILE tokens were pre-mined at the launch of the network to be distributed to the MOBILE subDAO operations fund administered by the Helium Foundation. Only 30B was distributed to the sbuDAO operations fund, and the remaining 20B was left under custody of the Helium Foundation. 

The 20B MOBILE currently under Foundation custody belongs to the MOBILE subDAO, and thus, itâ€™s up to the MOBILE subDAO to decide what to do with these tokens. Therefore, this HIP establishes a 3-year budget of what to do with 15B of the 20B tokens under Foundation custody. 

## Detailed Explanation

This HIP implements the following allocation of MOBILE tokens for the following areas: 

### Grant to Helium Foundation - 2B MOBILE Tokens
This HIP suggests giving the Helium Foundation a 2B MOBILE Token grant to be used in the manner noted below. Note, any funds not used by the 1,095th day after the passing of this HIP will be required to be burned by the Helium Foundation.  

#### Becoming a MOBILE Service Provider
500M of the 2B grant will be used for the Helium Foundation to stake to become a Service Provider, if approved by the MOBILE subDAO in a future HIP. 

#### Service Provider Hex Boosting
If the Helium Foundation becomes a Service Provider, 1B of the 2B grant will be burned to provide Service Provider Hex Boosting. Of the 1B grant, 500M is required to be used for Hex Boosting outside of the United States for Carrier Offload Wi-Fi. The foreign hexes in which this MOBILE will be burned to is at the discretion of the Helium Foundation, but no more than 100M can be burned in a single country. The remaining 500M is required to be burned to hexes within the United States, specifically within hexes in impoverished, rural, or other economically disadvantaged locations. These such areas are open to the Helium Foundations interpretation. 

#### Service Provider Grant
The remaining 500M of the 2B grant will be for the Helium Foundation to offer as a grant to attract new Service Providers by granting up to 250M MOBILE of their initial 500M stake. The foundation can nominate any potential Service Provider who has not already staked 500M. The MOBILE subDAO must approve grant nominations with a veMOBILE vote prior to the grant being applied. If approved by the MOBILE subDAO, the grant funds will not be distributed to the Service Provider, but be held in escrow by the Foundation to be used towards their 500M MOBILE stake.
  
### MOBILE Burn
The remaining 13B out of 15B MOBILE covered under this HIP will be burned over a 1,000 day period. The 13B shall be moved to a separate wallet under Foundation custody, and a smart contract will be created to automatically burn 13,000,000 MOBILE every day for 1,000 consecutive days. If technical restrictions, or unforeseen circumstances occur that prevents the MOBILE from being burned on a day, the MOBILE can be manually burned the following day or thereafter. 

### Remaining 5B
The remaining 5B will stay within Foundation custody, and a future HIP may determine what it is used for.   

## Drawbacks
One potential drawback is that the MOBILE subDAO is not mature, and there may be a need in the future for the 15B MOBILE that is being used in this proposal


## Alternatives
One alternative is to do nothing, and continue to allow the foundation to keep custody of the 20B MOBILE tokens in case circumstances arise where there is a need to use the funds. 

Another alternative is to burn all 20B MOBILE tokens, effectively reducing the total MOBILE circulating supply by 20B. However, as noted in the drawback above, this would prevent these funds from being used in the future if they are needed. 

The last alternative is to propose different ways in which this MOBILE will be used. 


## Success Metrics
This HIP will be noted as successful if at the end of 3 years, at least 13B out of the 15B proposal is burned.
