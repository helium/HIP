- Original HIP PR: [#1138](https://github.com/helium/HIP/pull/1138)
- Voting Requirements: veHNT Holders

## Summary

If approved and implemented, this proposal would mark the end of the current Helium governance system as it stands today. The authority to make governance decisions will transition to Nova, which will act as the Supreme Ruler of Helium Governance for the next four years.

During this time, Nova will focus on creating a new governance model, which will be proposed within the next year. The intent is to address the shortcomings of the current system while ensuring that governance decisions prioritize the long-term success of the network.

Additionally, Nova will introduce a rescind vote endpoint specifically for the veMOBILE holders for HIP 138, allowing original voters to retract their decisions. This is motivated by the outcome of HIP 138, which failed due to misaligned voting that demonstrated the community’s inability to consistently make decisions that benefit the network as a whole.

## Motivation

#### Governance Shortcomings

The failure of HIP 138 for MOBILE revealed a critical flaw in the current governance structure: reliance on community voting does not always lead to the best outcomes for the network. The decision to reject HIP 138 caused significant delays in aligning network incentives and missed a crucial opportunity for MOBILE’s growth. This highlights the need for a governance system that prioritizes rational, network-aligned decision-making over fragmented community sentiment.

#### Unified Leadership

By centralizing governance authority under Nova, Helium can ensure decisions are made with strategic foresight and accountability. Nova, as a neutral and experienced entity, will act as a steward of the ecosystem during this transition. This centralized approach is not permanent, but necessary to provide stability and course correction.

#### Rescind Vote Endpoint

To address the direct impact of HIP 138’s failure, Nova will create a rescind vote endpoint specifically for the veMOBILE holders and specifically for HIP 138. This will allow voters who contributed to HIP 138’s rejection to reverse their decision. This mechanism empowers the community to correct past mistakes and demonstrates Nova’s commitment to balancing centralized leadership with community engagement.

## Proposed Changes

#### Governance Transition:

Effective immediately, all governance decisions will be made by Nova.
This centralized governance structure will last for a period of four years.
Nova will propose a new governance model by the end of 2025 for community review and approval.

#### Rescind Vote Endpoint:

Nova will add a new endpoint to the governance platform specifically for the veMOBILE holders, enabling voters to rescind their votes specifically for HIP 138.
This feature will allow for a re-evaluation of critical governance decisions made by the community for HIP 138.

#### Suspension of Community Voting:

All future governance votes by veHNT, veIOT, and veMOBILE holders are suspended for the four-year transition period.

## Rationale

#### Clarity and Focus:

A simplified governance model ensures Helium’s resources are directed toward building and growing the network, rather than resolving ongoing governance debates.

#### Learning from HIP 138:

The rejection of HIP 138 was a turning point that underscored the need for a more guided approach. Without centralized oversight, the community risks making decisions that undermine the network’s growth potential.

#### Accountability:

Nova, as the Supreme Ruler, will remain accountable to the community through transparency reports and the eventual proposal of a new governance structure.

## Conclusion

HIP 140 represents a pivotal moment for Helium’s governance. By transitioning to centralized oversight under Nova, the network will address its governance shortcomings and lay the foundation for a better governance model.
