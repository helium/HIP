# Summary
[summary]: #summary

  This proposal is used for helping gaining conseous on the blockchain for HIPs. Currently it is done by a few people who can say I want to do this. As observed from the DEWI calls it is mainly the helium team, and less then 50 others. With this, evey miner on the blockchain can vote if they would like changes to the blockchain. This will give more power to the people who are currently running the blockchain.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

  Allow more people to have a more democratised voting to everyone on the blockchain.

# Stakeholders
[stakeholders]: #stakeholders

* People with miners and runing the network. The small people are going to have the vote. Fulfilling the networks goal to be the people's network.

* Everyone who is actively supporting the network can have a say, unlike today where there is few amount of people who can make a change.

# Detailed Explanation
[detailed-explanation]: #detailed-explanation

- This hip will propose a few changes to the blockchain. The way I propose the block chain to move is making a new token called voting. Which can be generated when a transaction of a change is proposed, all the miners on the network will get a token awared to them. 
  The transaction done by the miner will have to inclued the proposal, and a github link to the the hip. And then they will burn 10 hnt to send the transaction. Then the blockchain will then make 2 wallets that can only accept the voting tokens, and distrubute 1 voting token per miner to all the wallets. Then at the end of the time limit there will either be a consesous to move forward, or there will not be. I propose the limit to be 65% This is not a simple majority but it is not extreamly high to make changes imposible. 

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

- People with more helium tokens then miners will lose out. They can't vote as much. They will have less of a stake then someone who has more miners.

# Rationale and Alternatives
[alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

Currently if you really want to change something you have to make a hip, get a dewi call approval and get the helium team on board. It is slow, and it allows a minority to control the direction of the network,

# Unresolved Questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

- How devlopment work.

# Deployment Impact
[deployment-impact]: #deployment-impact

Describe how this design will be deployed and any potential imapact it may have on
current users of this project.

- Current users will get more ablitiy to vote on the chain.

- There will be a need to educate people on how a hip works.

- This should be able to added in to the blockchain pretty easily with the sidechain functionality. 

# Success Metrics

   This will be sucesssful when there is future hips are voted via this.
