## Summary

This hip aims to remove the requirement for the hip-19 maker program for the IOT network moving forward and adjusting the onboarding costs and process, while upgrading the PoC system to handle devices that would try to harm the network. Moving forward all hotspots would be required to onboard themselves. 

## Motivation

- More and more makers are defaulting their maker account leaving hotspot owners without the onboarding credit that was paid (assumed to be included in the price of the hotspot), currently the owner has two options, self fund the $50 onboarding and first locations assert or hope that the maker will respond to foundations requests to update the maker wallet with the onboarding credits, and get to the onboarding credits before they are depleted. This is a poor experience for the hotspot owner and leaves the onboarding process a guessing game.
- The whole user experience with hip-19 hasn't been smooth makers have exited the ecosystem or are slow to support requests from users or the foundation.
- It would remove the need for specialized LoRaWAN hardware to be manufactured for the helium network.
- Moving forward users would have the expectation that they need to onboard their hotspot and would be able to do so without the need for a maker to be involved.

## Stakeholders

- Makers. This would remove the requirement for them to be involved in the onboarding process.
- Makers with outstanding DC in their wallet.
- Hotspot owners. They would need to acquire the required crypto funds to onboard their hotspot.
- Mcc. This would mean that they would not need to approve makers into the program going forward.
- Novalabs. As the current maintainer of the deny list if this hip was implemented the deny list would be reserved for the most serious cases of bad acting and exploits.
- Foundation. As the current maintainer of the Solana systems for helium this would mean development time from the foundation to implement changes to the onboarding system.

## Detailed Explanation

This hip would remove the need for a hotspot to be maker approved to be onboarded to the network and updating PoC, this would also remove the need for hotspots to have a secure element to store the hotspots ID to be eligible for PoC rewards. The secure element was used to provide resistance to someone creating large numbers of cloud gateways with the intention of extracting tokens from the network. This hip proposes that the current deny list systems are implemented into PoC, these include:
1) minimum functionality, for a gateway to be able to function with a sensor it needs to be able to witness and beacon correctly. Currently the node deny list contains hotspots which only do one of these functions. This hip proposes that a hotspot that does not witness or beacon correctly would not be eligible for PoC rewards. This would be checked at the end of the epoch and the hotspot would be denied for the next epoch, If a hotspot is able to receive a witness in a given epoch it should be able to be heard correctly when it beacons and vice versa, This would be a good indicator that the hotspot is functioning correctly.
2) Move edge based denials into the PoC system and make the models public. This would bring more responsiveness to the system meaning a more real time response to bad intentions. This would also allow the system to be more automated and allow the network to focus on other tasks, also allowing transparency to the edge based system and allow the community to see the models and how they are performing. 
For new models or classifiers to be added the hip process would need to be followed to ensure that the models are not biased and are fair to all hotspots on the network.

This hip would also retire hip-19 and the maker program, allowing off the shelf LoRaWAN gateways or components to be used on the network. This does come with risk, however the risk would be lowered substantially by the new PoC system continued implementation of hip-83 and session keys.

The onboarding system would need to be changed to allow any wallet to pay and sign the onboarding fees this Proposes that in the new onboarding flow a user should be able it initiates the onboarding process with SOL, HNT or IOT tokens. This would mean entering the helium ecosystem can be as simple as Obtaining Solana, something that would be required transactions to happen, claiming, staking, converting and transferring of Network tokens.

This hip currently proposes that onboarding fees should be set to the mean of the 75th percentile of the average rewards of the hotspots on the network for the last 14 epochs(this needs supporting data to find the level of resistance it would provide), this would be updated every epoch inline with when Rewards are issued. This would be done to ensure there is a minimum level of time needed to profit from bad acting, as the resistance offered by the onboarding fees can be volatile.

The oracles would need to be updated to check the status of the hotspot during the previous epoch and be able to deny the hotspot for the next epoch if it was not able to witness or beacon correctly, it also would need to be able to check a PoCs edge to see if that edge should be rewarded. 

## Drawbacks

- The risk of bad actors trying to exploit the network. The maker program is designed to prove that hardware exists for a hotspot on the network, we would lose this security. So the mitigations need to be shown to be somewhat effective.
- If an exploit is found in the PoC system the network needs to be very reactive in shutting down the exploit and mitigating the damage, as removing the maker program would allow bad actors to create large numbers of hotspots to try and exploit the network.

## Rationale and Alternatives

- Remove onboarding fees completely, this would allow users to onboard any approved hotspot for free regardless of the makers' wallet balance. This would be a good user experience but would not solve all issues with the maker program.
- Keep the maker program and onboarding fees, this would keep the current maker program and onboarding fees in place and continue to allow hotspot makers to work in good faith.
- Remove makers from the Network, this would stop these makers from being able to onboard new hotspots to the network this is a 1 way fix and would still leave people with un-onboarded hotspots and no way to onboard them.



## Unresolved Questions

- What happens to the makers DC in the maker wallet? Sensecap currently have around $1.5 million in DC along with other makers that have a large amount of onboards awaiting to be used, currently there is no easy way to get that DC back.
- What stipulations need to be in place with current approved makers to ensure their hotspots can continue to work on the network.
- Is the current Denylist strong enough to protect the network from bad actors?
- Does the IOT subDAO want to keep the onboarding fees paid in HNT or have them paid in IOT?
- Do we want hotspots currently on the onboarding server to be grandfathered in and not be required to pay the onboarding fees relieving the current owners waiting for makers to top up?


## Deployment Impact

Oracles would need to be coded to function in the same manner as the current deny list as outlined above.
Oracles would need to be able to track the current onboarding costs and update the onboarding costs every epoch.


Onboarding systems would need to be updated to allow any wallet to pay the onboarding fees

Documentation would need to be updated to reflect the change in the PoC system and the onboarding system.

This hip would not be reversible as it would require a large overhaul of the current system and would require releasing makers from hip-19.



## Success Metrics

- No more failed onboards due to maker not responding to requests from the foundation.
- A reduction in the number of hotspots on the deny list.
- A more visible system to inform hotspot owners of the status/health of their hotspot.
- No substantial increase in bad actors on the network.
