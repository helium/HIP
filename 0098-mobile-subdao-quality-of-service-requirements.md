[HIP 74](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0074-mobile-poc-modeled-coverage-rewards.md) - Established modeled proof of coverage, and modeled coverage points.

[HIP 85](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0085-mobile-hex-coverage-limit.md) - Established limits to how many radios are rewarded proof of coverage rewards per res12 hex based on overlapping coverage. 

[HIP 93](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0093-addition-of-wifi-aps-to-mobile-subdao.md) - Established Wi-Fi Access Points to be onboarded and rewarded to the Helium 5G network.


## Summary
This Helium Improvement Proposal (HIP) sets quality of service (QOS) requirements that were noted within this [blog post](https://docs.helium.com/mobile/proof-of-coverage/).

## Motivation 
Previous QOS requirements were implemented for the MOBILE network without community input and vote. As these requirements were previously implemented without a HIP, a HIP is being created to memorialize these QOS requirements. 


## Stakeholders
MOBILE Deployers - MOBILE Deployers will be affected, as they will have to continue to meet speedtest and heartbeat requirements in order to earn rewards for Proof of Coverage (PoC).

Service Providers and Subscribers - Service Providers and Subscribers will benefit from this HIP, as it encourages MOBILE Deployers to have appropriate backhaul for their deployments, allowing for faster and smoother connections to the network. 

## Detailed Explanation 
These QOS requirements only impact MOBILE Rewards for PoC, and do not affect rewards for the transfer of data. 

### Uptime Heartbeats
A "heartbeat" is data sent by the Wi-Fi Access point and or 5G Hotspot indicating that a connected Radio is authorized to transmit 5G coverage.

Heartbeats occur every 60 seconds and transmit authorizations are valid for 240 seconds. This rolling overlap ensures that a Small Cell Radio can broadcast on an ongoing basis while allowing for brief interruptions.

To encourage reliable signal availability, 5G Hotspots and connected CBRS Small Cell Radios and Wi-Fi Access Points must generate at least one valid heartbeat per hour in 12 unique hours of the 24-hour Reward Period to earn Proof of Coverage (PoC) rewards. 



#### Heartbeat Reward Tiers

Each Radio and Access Point is given a heartbeat multiplier of either 0 or 1. This multiplier only affects Proof of Coverage rewards.


Each Radio and Access Point is awarded 1 point for a valid heartbeat in each hour, with a maximum of 24 points in the Reward Period. All Radios and Access Points with at least 12 points in the 24-hour Reward Period are given a heartbeat multiplier of 1 and will be eligible to earn PoC MOBILE Rewards.

### Speed Test Reward Tiers
Many locations where connectivity is being deployed, including some rural areas, do not always have the high-speed Internet connectivity needed to meet the acceptable Internet requirements for Genesis rewards consistently. Note, the tiering and multipliers proposed below are only applicable to PoC rewards, MOBILE Rewards for data transfers are not affected. 

Often these areas do not have good cellular coverage either. That's why it is essential to incentivize Helium deployments in less well-connected areas.

Speed Test results are categorized into one of four Tiers - Acceptable, Degraded, Poor, and Fail.


|Speed Test Tier| Speedtest Multiplier| Requirement (speeds in Mbps, latency in ms)  |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Acceptable    | 1.00X               |100+ Download, AND 10+ Upload, AND <50 Latency|
| Degraded      | 0.50X               |50+ Download, AND 5+ Upload, AND <75 Latency  | 
| Poor          | 0.25X               |30+ Download, AND 2+ Upload, AND <100 Latency |
| Fail          | 0.00X               |<30 Download, OR <2 Upload, OR >100 Latency   |



Tiered Speed Test values are used as a multiplier in Rewards calculations as follows:
Speed Test Results are put into Tiers based on the minimum value of each Download, Upload, and Latency (logical AND).
Speed Test results that do not meet the minimum requirements for any Download, Upload, or Latency are considered to have Failed and are not eligible for PoC Rewards until the Speed Test Average is improved (logical OR).

If a device (Radio and or Wi-Fi Access Point) is given a speed tier of “Fail”, the device will stop broadcasting a signal until a speed test tier of “Poor” or greater is given to that device. 

#### Multiplier Effect
Upon implementation of [HIP 74](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0074-mobile-poc-modeled-coverage-rewards.md), this multiplier will be applied the total modeled coverage points received by that radio/access point. The multipliers will be used within the following order:

Heartbeat Multiplier
Speed Test Multiplier 
Any other multipliers, such as the ones approved in [HIP 85](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0085-mobile-hex-coverage-limit.md) (Upon implementation of [HIP 74](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0074-mobile-poc-modeled-coverage-rewards.md), this multiplier will be applied the total modeled coverage points received by that radio/access point.)

See the table below for examples of how the multipliers will affect modeled coverage points (MCP):


|Device|Initial MCP|Heartbeat Multiplier| Speed Test Multiplier| HIP 85 Multiplier| Total MCP|
|------|-----------|--------------------|----------------------|------------------|----------|
| A    | 1,000     | 1.00X              |  1.00X               |  1.00X           | 1,000.00 |
| B    | 1,000     | 1.00X              |  0.75X               |  0.75X           | 562.50   |
| C    | 1,000     | 1.00X              |  0.50X               |  1.00X           | 500.00   |
| D    | 1,000     | 1.00X              |  0.00X               |  1.00X           | 0.00     |
| E    | 1,000     | 0.00X              |  1.00X               |  1.00X           | 0.00     |



## Rationale 
As the Helium 5G network matures, it’s vitally important that the quality of the network and deployments provide usable and consistent coverage. 


## Success Metrics
As most of what is written in this HIP has already been previously implemented, this HIP will be considered successful if it is passed. If this HIP does not pass, any quality of service metrics already previously established outside of a HIP process, such as speed test and heartbeat requirements must immediately be removed from the Helium 5G network.
