Helium Improvement Proposals

_"How a bill becomes a law"_

More details on process and how to participate can be found in HIP7,
["A Process For Managing Helium Improvement Proposals"](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0007-managing-hip-process.md).

If you have questions or feedback, please ask in
[#hip-open-discussion in the community Discord](https://discord.gg/helium). Each proposal in
discussion also has its own dedicated channel.

**Looking for HIP19 hotspot manufacturer applications?** Those have moved to their own dedicated
repository:
