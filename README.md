Helium Improvement Proposals

_"How a bill becomes a law"_

More details on process and how to participate can be found in HIP7, ["A Process For Managing Helium Improvement Proposals"](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0007-managing-hip-process.md).

If you have questions or feedback, please ask in [#hip-open-discussion in the community Discord](https://discord.gg/helium). Each proposal in discussion also has its own dedicated channel.

**Looking for HIP19 hotspot manufacturer applications?** Those have moved to their own dedicated repository: [dewi-alliance/hotspot-manufacturers](https://github.com/dewi-alliance/hotspot-manufacturers)
