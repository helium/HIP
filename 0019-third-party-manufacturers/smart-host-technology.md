## Hardware Security

Our Helium miner security will be relying on a VPN System to protect The swarm_key. For double authentication with our servers, after verification the server will send out the swarm key which has been pre-encrypted using the associated VPN. The encrypted swarm key is sent to the miner and the miner then decrypts and loads the swarm key into memory to begin mining.
Our Helium miner system provides better security since our systems can revoke the swarm key should the miner not be authorized, authenticated, or other fraud and tampering is detected.
