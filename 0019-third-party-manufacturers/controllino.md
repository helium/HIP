# CONTROLLINO
### Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per [HIP19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md)

## Summary

![alt text](https://www.controllino.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HIP19_Logo.png "Controllino Logo")

Controllino is an industry-leading manufacturer of industrial control and automation systems based on open hardware. Our customers range from small startups and hobbyists, to large enterprises like **Google, Boeing, Volkswagen, The Boring Company** and many more.

## Company Information

Our company was established in 2016 and has since then become the market leader in open hardware products for the industrial automation community, with over 100.000 products sold to date. We are well-respected for the ability to provide **reliable, safe, incredibly flexible and industry-ready hardware**.

We want to make sure that everybody has the opportunity to stand up against traditional, proprietary industry hardware companies. Forget about vendor lock-ins and other innovation blockers. We will never limit your possibilities. Some in the industry even call us the **Automation Rebels**, which we think is a quite fitting summary for our products and company mindset in general.

All these values and beliefs are represented by the Helium community and technology as well. Helium has incredible potential to disrupt the industrial automation and IoT landscape and the community is growing rapidly day by day. That motivates and drives us to contribute to that disruption with as many resources as we can - not just by building hotspots, but with a **full hardware and software ecosystem**. We want to do this not because of pure financial motivation, but because we **truly believe in open source and decentralization.**

## Product Information

Our first hotspot will be called **Controllino Hotspot** and will be based on Raspberry Pi and derivative boards, similar to the approach of other hotspot manufacturers, mainly to stay compatible with current mining and software standards. But as the network will transition from full to light hotspots, we’d like to offer more lightweight products in terms of computational power and production cost.

All Hotspots will be provided with a custom user interface for configuring and managing the device. We are evaluating options to integrate main configuration options via the official Helium app, if that is possible and desired.

The first batch of our Controllino Hotspot will be shippable **within just a few weeks**, as we have already secured chip stock for the devices, custom-made cases and antennas at our own financial risk, even if we are just kicking off the HIP 19 approval process. Our production line is ready and prepared as well. 

### Our Product Pipeline

#### Hotspots

* **Controllino Hotspot** | A standalone Helium hotspot with “full hotspot” capability and transition to light hotspot when available. Based on Raspberry Pi hardware and transitionable to light hotspot when validators launch on mainnet.

#### Light Hotspots

* **Controllino Hotspot Lite** | A standalone Helium light hotspot, based on more efficient and affordable embedded hardware (Dual Cortex M7+M4 based or similar).
* **Controllino Gateway - Helium Module** | A LoRa / Helium LongFi addon module for our Controllino industrial gateway (based on M7+M3; with Ethernet, WiFi & Bluetooth connectivity)

#### Sensors

We would like to build a wide range of sensors that are usable out of the box and can be integrated quickly with the Helium Network. 
* Temperature Sensor
* Humidity Sensor
* Pressure Sensor
* Proximity Sensor
* Ultrasonic Sensor
* Accelerometer & Gyroscope Sensor
* Gas Sensor
* Smoke Sensor

#### Software

**Controllino Cloud** will launch in Q3/2021, enabling industry-ready IoT applications for your devices and sensors. We will make sure that every sensor product that will be produced after the Controllino IoT Cloud launch can be easily integrated, so you can visualize, process and manipulate the data of your sensors.

#### Others

There is still lots of potential to innovate the Helium landscape not only with hardware, but with software and infrastructure solutions. We are constantly gathering ideas and figuring out possible market niches and use cases. Ideas will be presented to the community as soon as they are properly shaped.

## Previous shipments

We shipped over 100.000 devices to 140+ countries worldwide. All of our current devices are CE, UL and IEC61131-3 certified, which ensures that they meet the highest industry & electronic safety standards. All our products are therefore ready-to-use in real production environments.

## Customer Support

We offer lifetime customer support to every product we sell. Even if you just buy a single product and call us 5 years later because you need some help, we will help you. Lifetime customer support will of course be included for all our Helium hotspots.

Our devices will have a warranty of 2 years and we will keep spare stock in case of hardware damages or failures.

## Hardware Security

To meet the security requirements of current Helium hardware guidelines, we will, besides other industry standard software-based measures, use a crypto chip (ECC608) to generate and store the swarm_key during manufacturing.

Furthermore, physical anti tampering measures as known from other industry hardware will be put into place to make physical access to the chip more difficult.

## Hardware Information

* Raspberry Pi 3B+ or 4
* 868/915 MHz LoRa PCIe Module based on SX1302
* Sourcing: our components are sourced over European manufacturers and distributors with readily available stock that is already reserved for our products

## Manufacturing Information

We have produced over 100.000 devices and shipped them to 140+ countries worldwide since our founding year. We are very experienced in producing and delivering industry-ready hardware, from gathering supplies to shipping. Manufacturing happens directly in-house at our production facility in Austria, as well as in a partnered production facility in Taiwan. Each and every device goes through a strict QA process before it gets shipped out, as our hardware is mostly used in critical industrial environments.

## Proof of Identity

Details have been submitted privately to DeWi, as per HIP 19 guideline.

## Budget & Capital

As we are a thriving and well-established enterprise with stable capital flow, budget and financing topics are not a concern.

## Risks & Challenges

The current chip sourcing crisis is affecting almost every company that uses electronics in their products. Furthermore, increasing demand for LoRa chips will probably have a negative effect in terms of sourcing speed and prices. We are mitigating this risk by already reserving and buying critical components with our most trusted suppliers and planning orders and production months in advance. This is the only way to ensure quick and customer-friendly responses to market surges.
