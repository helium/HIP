## Budget & Capital

Based on the current estimate and market insight, Ruff intends to produce 2Ku per month in 2021 and allows production flexibility as customer demand requires.

Due to the necessity of components readiness for manufacturing gateway products, Ruff should balance cash flow and reserve a minimum US$1M as the budget for supply chain.

## Risks & Challenges

Since our factories are all in mainland China, there may be possible delay in transportation and maintenance of our products. We are planning to establish cooperation with international courier service should the proposal goes well.

Another thing to concern is the scale of our customer service with the growth of the network. More resource will be deployed.
