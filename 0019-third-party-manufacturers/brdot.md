# BrDot
### Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per [HIP19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md)

## Summary

BrDot is a spin-off from Fox IoT which is a Brazilian company that operates in the Electricity market, with intelligent monitoring solutions for transformers and distribution networks with a focus on combating losses, power quality and efficiency of the system as a whole. It has proprietary technology and the ability to develop hardware and software to meet the demands of LoRa industries. Since our main operation is based in Brazil, we intend to provide our products focused on the South American market, we believe that this region has great potential for LoRa solutions, thus, Helium potential.

We are proposing to make an Indoor Helium Hotspot Miner and an Outdoor Helium Hotspot Miner. Our first release will be the Indoor Helium Hotspot Miner, shown below.

## Company Information

Founded in 2017, Fox IoT is a company focused on IoT solutions, primarily using LoRaWAN. We meet different demands in the health and energy market, involving different data capture and processing. Our main products today are temperature monitoring for the cold chain and monitoring of magnitudes of the electrical network. Our equipment sends accurate, real-time data to our online platform. Our customers access through their devices and can see, among others, the data history, graphs and indicators to control their information.

We've been working with LoRa products for a few years and actively participate in the LoRa local community as part of The Things Network and various industry-related events. 

## Product Information

**Helium Indoor Hotspot Miner**

**Product Status:** In Development. First prototypes to be built shortly.

**Estimated Price:** USD 450.

Our first goal is to launch the Helium Indoor Hotspot Miner. Then, we plan to launch another version: the Helium Outdoor Hotspot Miner. Currently, the Indoor Hotspot Miner is being developed and tested.

The Miner has the following features:

* Powered By:
   * 1.4GHz 64-bit quad-core Arm Cortex-A53 CPU;
   * 1GB RAM;
* Comes with a LoRaWAN Gateway Module, which features:
   * Semtech’s SX1301 concentrator;
   * MAX-M8Q-0 GPS module;
* Comes in a stylish case;
* Powered by a 5V, 3A DC Power Source, via a Micro USB connection;
* Wi-Fi (2.4 and 5 GHz), Bluetooth & Ethernet Connectivity;
* Uses a Scobi’s AN915-ART-RPSMAM-JS 3dBi High Performance Antenna for LoRa communication;

**Helium Outdoor Hotspot Miner**

It has the same specifications from the Indoor Miner, but with an IP67 case and a fiberglass antenna with 5dbi gain. The product will be launched after the indoor version, as mentioned before.

The Miner has the following features:

* Powered By:
   * 1.4GHz 64-bit quad-core Arm Cortex-A53 CPU;
   * 1GB RAM;
* Comes with a LoRaWAN Gateway Module, which features:
   * Semtech’s SX1301 concentrator;
   * MAX-M8Q-0 GPS module;
* Comes in a stylish case;
* IP67 protection;
* Powered by a 5V, 3A DC Power Source, via a Micro USB connection;
* Wi-Fi (2.4 and 5 GHz), Bluetooth & Ethernet Connectivity;
* Uses a FIberglass 5dBi High Performance Antenna for LoRa communication for outdoor purposes;

## Customer Support

All products sold will have a 12-month warranty against manufacturing defects. Our support will be through our website, where each customer can open a ticket to receive information and guidance regarding the product.

In addition, our support will act proactively in the community through Discord and other means of communication that the community builds.

## Hardware Security

We plan to use the ECC608 chip as recommended by Helium to securely store the encrypted swarm keys. Also, we want to implement the following security items:

* Encrypted/locked firmware, so there won’t be possible for the user to make any modification that will compromise the device’s security;
* Physical protection of the SD card slot, using security seals/tape.

We can send a device for an audit to test the hardware security.

## Manufacturing Information

The company manages all technical and engineering development, as well as all supplier evaluation processes, to maintain the same level of quality in all products placed on the market. Our production process will take place with partner companies in Brazil, specialized in electronics assembly, presenting high production capacity and technical excellence. This partner will be responsible for assembling and testing the devices, and the entire process will undergo thorough evaluation processes before the products go to market.

## Proof of Identity

The proof of identity will be sent in private.

## Budget & Capital

We plan to proceed with a first batch of 2000 to 5000 units, but we can ramp up if pre-order demand requires it. We have investment partners that we can leverage if necessary, but we currently have the capacity to produce up to 5000 units without external resources.

## Risks & Challenges

We have seen a growing interest in cryptocurrency mining alternatives in the region over the past six months. Hundreds of influencers, with thousands of followers, investing large sums in GPUs for an average return of 12 months. Due to high taxes on imported goods, we believe it's quite strategic to have a local hotspots manufacturer in Latam. Brazil also has a local trade agreement: Mercosul, formed by Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and other countries, which is very important for distribution and to mitigate the cost of gateways purchased from other countries, reducing the friction for the adoption of the Helium network in the region.  

The product design and all technical parts of the project are nearly done. The main risks and challenges are the supply of Semtech’s SX1301 concentrator and assembly of the associated electronics. Fortunately, Fox IoT works with a local manufacturer which has a great throughput capability and knows and trusts they can deliver on schedule.

We will place the first production order immediately when we get manufacturer approval.
