**Embit®** designs and produces gateways and OEM devices and assists customers in development of IoT ad-hoc solutions from the idea to the implementation with a specific focus on **LoRa®** and **LoRaWAN®** networks. Our suite of products includes several types of access points both outdoor and indoor all designed with a particular attention to security and RF design.
We are making available our technology to the Helium network by proposing multiple access point solutions to the customers in order to meet the requirements for Helium Hotspot Miner and Helium Light Gateway.


## Company Information

**Embit was founded in 2004**, with the goal of bringing university researchers and local industries together.
**More than 17 years of RF experience** allows the company to provide the best solutions to its customers. Of course, when we talk about IoT, security is one of the most crucial points. For us, the most important thing is to protect devices connection and enable customers the deployment of secure connected applications on networks.
**We have been working on LoRa® since its beginning as an IoT technology**. We designed our first LoRa® OEM module in 2014 and our first LoRa® Gateway in 2015. Since then, we have designed many different gateways solutions refining and adapting our devices to the market needs. Our suite of products includes both high-performance multi-protocol outdoor and cost-effective makers-oriented indoor gateways, all of them designed to ensure high reliability in terms of security and RF performances.
**We have been collaborating with big players** in the field of energy utilities and smart metering and tens of thousands of our gateways are currently offering LoRaWAN® connectivity over large industrial and urban areas in northern Italy. Over the years, our modules and gateways have been deployed with large flexibility over diverse and disparate scenarios, both in Europe and in the world, proving their reliability for most of the typical IoT applications such as metering, smart lighting, smart home and building, smart agriculture and smart industry automation.
**Our strength relies in our flexibility and in our capability to guide our customers during the whole engineering process**, from the idea to the solution. This is possible thanks to the intrinsic customizability of our hardware and software solutions.
**We strongly believe in the Helium paradigm**, and we think that our business model could perfectly fit the requirements of this innovative IoT environment.

## Hardware Security Element

Embit strongly believes network security to be one of the main key point of current and incoming IoT network architectures, that's why all our products (both gateways and modules) have always been equipped with reliable Crypto Elements.

*	All our gateways embed a Crypto Unit (ECC508A/ECC608A) which is used to provide a wide set of encryption algorithms and cryptographic operations.
*	The key-storage capability of the Crypto unit can be exploited to securely store the *swarm_keys*.

We are more than happy to provide our gateways for audit and we are completely available for any kind of question and clarification.


## Manufacturing Information

Embit produces hundreds of thousands of gateways and radio modules every year which are shipped worldwide. We refined our production process over time by gradually adding new levels of validation.
*	The supply of materials is done through verified channels from silicon manufacturers and distributors.
*	Production takes place in a centre of excellence located in our territory. This guarantees an attentive and complete supervision over the whole production process.
*	Our products are assembled in our production facility. All devices undergo a rigorous QA process through 3D optical inspection, X-Ray inspection to assess the correct assembly of all the components. The production facility is equipped with an EMC lab with an anechoic chamber to perform pre-compliance tests.
*	The testing procedure is tracked and all data relative to each S/N are stored in our DataBase. The entire procedure is retained as a guarantee for the customer.
*	Our intention is to produce 10,000 Helium dedicated gateways per batch.

Embit srl is a company with more than 17 years experience in this sector with a clear profile created over time on delivering services and products.

## Risks & Challenges

Electronic component shortages have been a hindrance on electronics marketplaces. The pandemic has complicated the global supply even further which, due to the rise of the demand, has been translated to constant rising prices. Luckily, thanks to the strategy chosen, we have been able to stay on our feet and have enough stock components to be able to fulfill the planned production and be competitive.
