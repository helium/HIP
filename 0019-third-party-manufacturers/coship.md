* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer? Yes.
This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.

## Proof of Identity

Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives, e.g. as GitHub comments. 
* Contact details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub. Yes.

## Budget & Capital (required)

* How many of these are you hoping to make and sell? Q4 product shipment capacity is up to 5K. The exact number is subject to negotiation with Helium.

* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? What is your plan for additional financing if required? This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures -- getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.
Currently, we don’t need financing. We are a listed company in China. Our information is public.

## Risks & Challenges (required)

Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality, and how you might address them.
As this is the first attempt to cooperate with Helium, both Helium and we don’t have enough trust to and knowledge of each other. Both parties will be there after some time. We want to reach cooperative attitude first and then negotiate on various issued with Helium.
