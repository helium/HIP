# LLC Smart Global

### **Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per [HIP19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md)**

## **Summary**

Smart Global is a IoT devices manufacturer. We produce wearables, gateways, positioning anchors and firmware for the devices. Our main product is a smart safety solution for people working in industrial companies.

We are to make the regular Hotspot for indoor and outdoor.

## **Company Information**

Smart Global is an IoT devices manufacturer and an IoT platform developer. We provide our clients with innovative functionalities to manage security of employees and production sites. We build solid devices which are stable in challenging environments which our clients work in. Our gateways are based on LoRaWAN protocol and security modules which were designed together with Kaspersky company.

Smart Global was founded in 2018 and since then we have delivered IoT based solutions for several large oil and gas companies. We also have extensive experience in certification of radio-electronic devices for our local market. We are able to get certificates either for locally manufactured or imported devices.

We share Helium’s mission to create decentralized world network for IoT devices. We believe that this type of network stimulates developing new IoT based products and creates new opportunities. Manufacturing hotspots is our contribution to this mission.

## **Product Information**

We are  targeted to make highly secured Hotspots:

- Indoor Helium Hotspot Miner, estimated price 250$
- Outdoor Helium Hotspot Miner, estimated price 350$
- Propose to build ExtraSecured Hotspot, estimated price TBD

## **Customer Support**

We already have a 24/7 support service for our clients. We consult our customers through three channels: phone, mail and chat .

Working with international customers may be challenging for us at first. Because right now we don’t have as many clients outside of our country as we would like to.

If there is any issue with a device and it can not be fixed remotely by the support team we can send a replacement of the device.

## **Hardware Security**

As our main clients now are industrial companies so we must provide highly secured devices and prevent data leakage and defend against cyberattacks. To create the best security tools we became partners with Kaspersky company which is well known as cybersecurity solutions developer. Our current gateway contains a security module which provides safe firmware update, device protection, attacks and anomalies detection.

The same approach seems reasonable for Hotspots Miner. To provide Hotspot with cyberimmunity we propose:

- Encrypted firmware, busses and miner swarm_key storage (ECC chip)
- Security in the core of OS
- Secure Boot (Verification of the integrity and authenticity of the firmware using cryptographic methods on IoT devices before loading the image. Unauthorized altered or damaged firmware will not be loaded. Secure Boot can be used together with hardware key store. Optional for ExtraSecured.)
- Firmware security update center (firmware update using correctly signed and encrypted images from trusted sources. Optional for ExtraSecured.)
- IDS/IPS (And firewall. Optional for ExtraSecured)
- Root of trust (Based on Chain of Trust. The starting point of trust is chosen depending on the required guarantees and in difficult cases is set at the hardware level. Optional for ExtraSecured.)

## **Manufacturing Information**

Each year we expand the production of our devices and improve the supply chain. We are open for new business opportunities. Our productive capacities are large.

In our labs we build prototypes of the devices and manufacture them with the help of partners. We work with reliable companies and have long term contracts with them. Here are our main three partners:

- [https://en.iotvega.com/](https://en.iotvega.com/) - IoT devices manufacturer.
- [http://eriskip.com/en](http://eriskip.com/en) -  microelectronics  and gas detectors manufacturer.
- [https://www.industrial-iot.it/en/](https://www.industrial-iot.it/en/) - IoT Smart Solutions provider in Europe.

We get all of our products certificated and we also have experience in certificating of imported devices. So if there are any issues with certification of current Helium suppliers in Russia we can provide help and support.

## **Proof of Identity**

Ready to provide any required information.

## **Budget & Capital**

We can start manufacturing with 1000 devices and we have enough production capacity for this. We also have enough finance for the first batch. If more devices are required we have capacity to enlarge number to 7000. As for financing we have a long term investor which has already confirmed readiness to support us in this task. 

## **Risks & Challenges**

We have a good experience in working with LoRaWAN technology and providing a solution based on it. We see no technical risks.

- Challenge for us is to organize shipping outside Russia. We don’t have much experience in this area. But we consider it manageable based on the feedback from our partners and local transportation companies.
- Risk for Helium is related to our local radio-frequency regulation laws. The laws can be changed and prevent using imported devices as it is already done for some other industries. But this risk can be mitigated by manufacturing devices in Russia. Our local brands are more preferable for government and supported by them on all levels.
