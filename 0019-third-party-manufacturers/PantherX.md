###  Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos, videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better.
We host a private LoRa network server (based on lorawan-server) and use Raspberry Pi 4 and an adapter board (self-designed and built) for the hardware test and the power consumption of the whole prototype is ~ 5W.<br>

###  Your plan for software setup and configuration for the devices. This would presumably include remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise.
We will support the official Helium application and provide a customized setup and configuration environment based on OpenWrt. In order to ensure a good user experience, we are happy to do our best and work with the community to prioritize improving the official Helium application. For technology geeks, we recommend the OpenWrt version.

###  What is your expected production and delivery timeline? Photos and videos welcome.<br>
Timeline:<br>
Pre-sale -15 August 2021<br>
Mass production - 25 August 2021<br>
Shipping to customers - Expected on Early September 2021<br>

# Customer Support
We will set up a team to provide customers with comprehensive pre-sales consultation and after-sales service. The customer service center which includes the pre-sale consulting department, technical service department, and product maintenance department. The technical service department is responsible for solving technical problems that may arise while the after-sales services focuses on reporting, processing and fixing the technical issues raised by customers. The product maintenance department is responsible for product maintenance and order traceability.

We provide a 2-Year Warranty for our hardware.<br>

Customers can contact us via email, Discord, Twitter, Telegram, Instagram and official website.<br>

# Hardware Security
In terms of hardware security, we implement three levels of protection measures. The higher the level, the safer the system will be.<br>

Level 1: protect swarm_key with ATECC508A compatible ECC chips.<br>

Level 2: Based on Level 1, the SSH access of the hotspot adopts a password-free scheme, which is carried out entirely through the private key, but the private key is not stored on the hotspot.<br>

Level 3: Based on Level 2, we add firmware signature support, but do not support third-party firmware upgrade.<br>

# Hardware Information
*	Which security (swarm) element are you using?<br>
ATECC508A compatible ECC chips<br>

* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway (ie SX1302/03 & SX1250s or SX1301/08 & SX1255/57)<br>
SX1302&SX1250<br>

*	Where are you sourcing your components from?<br>
Our components are sourced from all over the world, both online and offline. We have established good cooperation with a number of big suppliers who reserve enough components for us. 

*	How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure?<br>
We aim to produce at least 10000 pcs every month.
