## Hardware Security

In terms of hardware security, we have considered three levels of measures. The higher the level, the safer.

Level 1: protect swarm_key with ATECC508A compatible ECC chips.

Level 2: Base on Level 1, the SSH access of the hotspot adopts a password-free scheme, which is carried out entirely through the private key, but the private key is not stored on the hotspot.

Level 3: Base on Level 2, add firmware signature support, do not support third-party firmware upgrade.
