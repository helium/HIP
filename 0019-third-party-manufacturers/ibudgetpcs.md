## Company Information (required)

* What is your company name? 
* How long have you been in business? 
* What kind of products have you created? 
* How many have you sold? 
* What brought you to Helium etc?

**-My name is Michael and my business partner’s name is Jonathan and we are two people who became the best of friends through our love of technology, which even led to us starting our own company together! Our company is called iBudgetPCs and we started in December of 2019. We started the company as an affordable way for gamers to join the PC gaming community and come together as one. We build computers together and install software on them and ship them out to customers. To date, we have sold over 350 units. We discovered Helium through a connection with a close business partner and now friend.
**

## Product Information (required)

Your time to shine! What are you building? What’s so great about it? 
* What is your approximate price point? 
* Detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts
* Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos, videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better.
* Your plan for software setup and configuration for the devices. This would presumably include remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise.
* What is your expected production and delivery timeline?
Photos and videos welcome.

**-We have built a working prototype of a Helium Miner from a Raspberry Pi 4 and a RAK2245 LoRa WAN Pi Hat. This is our first foray into building a Light Hotspot. In the past we have repaired miners with graphics cards before and are well versed in the mining aspect, but the Helium IoT network piqued our interest. Our approximate price point for this Hotspot will be about $324.99 USD. We have this device set up through the Balena Cloud and up and running, with it even able to transmit data on the Helium network. We would love to and would be completely open to integrating with the official Helium app. And we would expect to produce and ship about 500 units a month, roughly 2 months after receiving orders.**

## Previous shipments (required)

Startups welcome! Answer No if that's the answer.
* Have you shipped anything in the past?
* Which countries have you previously shipped regulatory FCC or CE approved products? 
* Which countries do you plan to ship to? 

**-We have previously shipped Desktop computers all over the United States and to Canada, and we would ship these Hotspots there as well.**

## Customer Support (required)

* How will your customers be able to contact you for support for your products?
* For how long? How are you planning to handle repairs and replacements?

**-We have a team to deal with customer support on our other business end, and we can either add this Hotspot to their Customer Support devices or deal with it ourselves, either of which will work just as well. All will be done through email with a 24-48 hour response time, and through phone during our operating hours. Repairs and replacements will be covered for 6 months as long as it is a defect from our end and not from the customer mishandling the device, and support will be given for 1 to 2 years depending on how we see the first batch of Hotspots acting.**

## Hardware Security Element (required)

The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their `swarm_key` files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured, potentially including:

* Encrypted/locked-down firmware
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures like an ECC chip
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures.
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail)

**-Will be taken care of through disk encryption or through a ATECC608A ECC Chip, and definitely willing to submit a prototype for testing.
**

## Hardware Information (required)

Please let us know:
* Which security (swarm) element are you using?
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway (ie SX1302/03 & SX1250s or SX1301/08 & SX1255/57)
* We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs
* Where are you sourcing your components from?
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure?

**•	ATECC608A ECC Chip
•	SX1302
•	Amazon and RAK Wireless
•	Unsure of question**


## Manufacturing Information (required)

* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before? 
* Have you built gateways before?
* How many gateways did you make? 
* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer?
This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.

**We have not built gateways before, other than the working prototype we have of the Helium Miner on hand right now. We have built and delivered over 350 desktop computers. We put together every single one of them ourselves. Supply chain includes Amazon for immediate needs, and other B2B companies we are sourcing from including MALabs, EVGA, MSI, ASUS, RAK Wireless etc.**

## Proof of Identity

Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives, e.g. as GitHub comments. 
* Contact details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub.

## Budget & Capital (required)

* How many of these are you hoping to make and sell? 
* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? What is your plan for additional financing if required? This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures -- getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.

**If we can get approved, we are in the midst of a business deal with several companies who have a large Cryptocurrency involvement where they make over 500% profit per year and are extremely interested in purchasing over 5000 (Five Thousand) units on the low end, contingent on our manufacturing approval for these Hotspots. We are also in the middle of another business deal to merge with a Venture Capital firm who is VERY interested in this project we are undertaking. Upfront cost will be around One Million dollars, we will be able to have access to 750,000 (Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand) Dollars and will acquire 250,000 (Two Hundred and Fifty thousand) Dollars from this Venture Capital Firm**

## Risks & Challenges (required)

Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality, and how you might address them.

**One of the biggest challenges that could affect this process would be our lack of programming knowledge. I am currently in several online programming courses learning languages to better be able to handle more projects like this in the future, as well as this one. Another risk is the fact that we are not a startup as a company, but a startup in the world of radio hardware projects. This is a new undertaking for us, but nonetheless, we are extremely excited for it and constantly doing research daily on everything involved in a project like this.**
