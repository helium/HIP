## Product Information (required)

Your time to shine! What are you building? What’s so great about it? 
* What is your approximate price point?    The approximate price is 250$.
* Detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts   CPU：uad-core Cortex-A35，RAM：2GB  eMMC：32GB SD card：128GB， 802.11ac Wi-Fi module, Lora SX1302 module 
* Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos, videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better.
* Your plan for software setup and configuration for the devices. This would presumably include remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise.   we plan finish it  in the end of august.
* What is your expected production and delivery timeline?   we expexted production and delivery in end of 2021. 
Photos and videos welcome. 

## Previous shipments (required)

Startups welcome! Answer No if that's the answer.
* Have you shipped anything in the past?    Yes, our gateway products have shipped to customers. 
* Which countries have you previously shipped regulatory FCC or CE approved products?  we have shipped them to U.S. and Europe with FCC and CE cetification.
* Which countries do you plan to ship to?  U.S. and Europe

## Customer Support (required)

* For how long? How are you planning to handle repairs and replacements? warrenty ：We can repairs and replacements in 18 month. We have cooperative repair points worldwide.

## Hardware Security Element (required)

The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their `swarm_key` files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured, potentially including:

* Encrypted/locked-down firmware
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures like an ECC chip
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures.
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail)

1. We will protect and encrypt storage of the swarm_key by ECC608 chip.
2. We will submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly. 

## Hardware Information (required)

Please let us know:
* Which security (swarm) element are you using?  It's with ATECC608A
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway (ie SX1302/03 & SX1250s or SX1301/08 & SX1255/57)   we use the sx1302 LoRa chip 
* We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs     Yes, we use the sx1302 chip 
* Where are you sourcing your components from?             Chip agent
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure?   50K~100K

## Manufacturing Information (required)

* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?  Yes，We have been engaged in the design of wireless products. We have a professional RF design team, including antennas, PCBs, and schematics.And we also have factory to manufacture the gateway.  
* Have you built gateways before?      Yes， We have many IoT gateway products.
* How many gateways did you make?      More than 500K pcs
* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer?
This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.

## Proof of Identity

Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives, e.g. as GitHub comments. 
* Contact details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub.  Name: caoyanliang  Email: tiny.cao@hzdusun.com   title: VP 

## Budget & Capital (required)

* How many of these are you hoping to make and sell?    50K~100K
* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? What is your plan for additional financing if required? This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures -- getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.         We have a stable business line to provide sales income, so we don’t have to worry about cash flow, and we have a stable supply chain to provide material and billing guarantees

## Risks & Challenges (required)

Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality, and how you might address them.

We have powerful R&D ability and we have a top class R&D team. The team members are talented engineers and have much experience on IoT, wifi, wireless, networking, Linux technologues.
And actually we have already ported helium and make it running on our prototype hardware, but waiting for the Onboarding Maker Address to access to the blockchain. 
From techical point of view, there shall be no risk to build the helium product. We will overcome all the challenges and make it happen.
