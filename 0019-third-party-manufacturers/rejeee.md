## Hardware Security Element (required)

The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their `swarm_key` files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured, potentially including:

* Encrypted/locked-down firmware
Yes
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures like an ECC chip
Yes
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures.
Yes
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail)
Yes
## Hardware Information (required)

Please let us know:
* Which security (swarm) element are you using?
No
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway (ie SX1302/03 & SX1250s or SX1301/08 & SX1255/57)
SX1302/03
* We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs
No SX1301
* Where are you sourcing your components from?
From China
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure?
20K pcs for SX1302 and 500K+ for SX1276
## Manufacturing Information (required)

* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before? 
Yes
* Have you built gateways before?
Yes
* How many gateways did you make? 
More than 20K in the past.
* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer?
This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.

## Proof of Identity

Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives, e.g. as GitHub comments. 
* Contact details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub.
OK
## Budget & Capital (required)

* How many of these are you hoping to make and sell? 
20K+
* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? What is your plan for additional financing if required? This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures -- getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.
200,0000usd on hand.We have steady sales for LoRa gateway and modules, and sales volume per month is more than 300,000usd.
