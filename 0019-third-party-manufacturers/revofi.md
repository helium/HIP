**Summary**

RevoFi, LLC is a product development company specialized in building world class decentralized networking equipment and microservice cloud native software.

**Company Information**

RevoFi, LLC builds the RevoFi Micro, a Helium miner built on commodity hardware with extended networking capabilities. RevoFi Micro, in addition to extending the Helium network, adds Wifi-6 and Named Data Networking (NDN) networking capabilities. The Wifi-6 and NDN network provided by the miner also runs on the Revos blockchain and mines Revos. The miner has compute and storage capabilities for microservice workloads, such as AI applications, to be run on the device in exchange for data credit tokens paid to the owner of the miner.

Earn Revos (RVS) and Helium (HNT) cryptocurrencies mining Revos and Helium by building wireless coverage, a network, and a microservices edge platform. Anyone can join the network and provide Wi-Fi 6 + LoRaWAN wireless network coverage, while mining RVS on the Revos blockchain and HNT on the Helium blockchain. 

•	Efficient miner for new cryptocurrencies – Revos (RVS) & Helium (HNT)

•	Wi-Fi 6 technology with mesh capabilities for seamless high-speed broadband

•	LongFi™ technology maximizes LoRaWAN range

•	Complete set-up in minutes using a smartphone

•	Easily manage the Micro and earned tokens from a mobile app

Additional Features:

Democratize your Infrastructure, Decentralize the Edge

The micronized edge is here. The Revo Edge Gateway (REG) and Revo Access Point (RAP) deliver a unified compute, storage, and network delivery platform for microservices architecture. Built on commodity hardware, and interlacing market dominant technology, RevoFi is the meeting point for centralized and decentralized network value exchange.

**Customer Support**

Support will be provided via our service center leveraging zendesk for first line support, followed with e-mail and live chat. A community Discord, FAQ’s, documentation, and up to date images will be available on our website. Support may also be tiered based on the needs of the customer and the deployment.

Our website will provide product information regarding use, debug and bug fixes. We collect payment on pre-orders and refunds will not be accepted due to ordering lead times for supply chain requirements. Pre-orders are sequenced based on inventory cycles and stock levels at supplier warehouses and supply chain backorder volumes. RevoFi will provide an order tracking system that will provide transparency at all points of the order process. This includes a return label for manufacturer warranties of component replacements. All components are modular and can easily be replaced by the end user.

**Hardware Security**

RevoFi, LLC manufactures all products in a security first mindset. RevoFi Micro has a private certificate burned on the sm storage along with a root public certificate for mutual authentication with our servers. On authentication, the RevoFi key store checks if the miner is authorized for mining and if authorized, RevoFi will send out the assigned swarm key which has been pre-encrypted using the associated public cert with the miner. RevoFi doesn’t have the means to decrypt the swarm key since we throw away the private key after burning it on the Micro SD card. The encrypted swarm key is sent to the miner and the miner then decrypts and loads the swarm key into memory to begin mining.

The RevoFi system provides better security since our systems can revoke the swarm key should the miner not be authorized, authenticated, or other fraud and tampering is detected. In addition to our key management system, we also use adhesive breakable seals across the Micros SD cards into the Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano slots to prevent tampering.

**Manufacturing Information**

RevoFi has a team of sourcing experts with over 30 years of supply chain knowledge and experience for both foreign and domestic sourcing. Additionally, RevoFi is and will continue to evaluate our partnerships with our suppliers to continuously optimize inventory cycles and cost reductions. 

The design incorporates commodity commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components from specific suppliers and has forecast and KPI models to ensure consistency in delivery of goods. Multi level and tiered supply programs allow for additional redundancy in our supply chain that are continuously being vetted and optimized. Close relationships and integrations with our suppliers and channel partners help reduce risks for delivery of RevoFi products to our end users. 

**Proof of Identity**

Have emailed this information to helium’s support contact. Can be confirmed in a comment.

**Budget & Capital**

RevoFi has committed direct capital and has access to additional capital to meet the supply forecasts of 10-20k units per month for the RevoFi Micro. This includes working capital for both OPEX and CAPEX for sustained month over month increases in demand during the planned phases for the launch and post launch of the product.

**Risks & Challenges**

The main risk will be delays in shipments from international suppliers. These have been mitigated and reduced to minimum and RevoFi is working to ensure guaranteed supply lines for reduced time in customs and transport. 

RevoFi has reduced the challenges of development, product support, and other types of potential risks by our teams combined product experience and knowledge.
