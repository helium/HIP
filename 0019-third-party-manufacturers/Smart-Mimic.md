### Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per [HIP19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md)

## Summary

Smart Mimic, in partnership with Sagem Teknoloji announces commitment to launch and sustain production of a consumer first, home ready, Finestra gateway family which is purpose built for the Helium Network. The friendly design, features designed for everyday use,  integrated managed cloud services and compatible Smart Mimic gadgets ensure that the gateway will not sit forgotten behind a cable-infested cabinet but be proudly displayed on a desktop or window sill. This is a game changer, not only ensuring ‘range optimal’ locations for the gateway but also driving word of mouth conversation.

## Device Management Cloud

All Smart Mimic Products come ready to connect with the Mimic Cloud, an advanced intelligent, state of the art device management system purpose built for Smart Mimic client devices. This allows Smart Mimic’s team to dynamically monitor device health and if necessary proactively intervene as well as notify customers of device power status and health, improving overall customer experience. That being said, the gateway is fully compatible with the Helium App and the Helium Network.

## Integrated Consumer Devices

Smart Mimic plans to provide enhanced integration for its devices - the Mimic GO and upcoming Mimic Track, including (optional) attractive bundle pricing for consumers. Regardless the gateway will be always available as a standalone device. 

## Customer Support

Smart Mimic has multiple years of experience in supporting thousands of end consumers customers in the US and elsewhere. We also run our own branded ecommerce store. In Q2 we will be rolling out our Mimic GO and Mimic Track products into Amazon and later in Q2/Q3 into prestigious Tier 1 Retail brands. These processes are already well underway.

In order to scale for this kind of growth we have already onboarded team members with years of Amazon / FBA experience. We have also established a sophisticated hybrid 3PL network  across the USA Including to support product returns. 

All products currently being sold in the US have included warranties with customer friendly return policies. We have also established processes for high speed replacements in the rare event of a product replacement.

We are scheduled for rollout into Canada, EU and Lat Am by Q3, with planned 3PL and distribution partners for those areas as well. They also include warranties and easy to access support. 

We carry the necessary insurance, either directly or via relevant contracted partners  (that ship, import, sell  products) and for end use of product. 


## Hardware Security

Smart Mimic, along with our partner Sagem has prioritized secure designs and secure manufacturing from the very beginning. The Finestra gateways are no different. Our product has integrated ECC608 Crypto Authorization Cell to securely contain swarm-key.  And is planned to be sealed with epoxy to make it harder to reach internal electronics.

Our partner Sagem Teknoloji has been a trusted subcontractor for primes supplying Western military and govt entities. They have years of experience in highly secure manufacturing, physical and in-process protection of keys and in fabrication of tamper-resistant hardware electronic products as well as working with partners who specialize in the end to end secure transport of components for the same.

## Manufacturing, Budget & Capital

Smart Mimic and Sagem Teknoloji have committed adequate capital to produce upwards of 10K units per month. Adequate budget for parts procurement, manufacturing and distribution have been set aside to meet this requirement keeping in mind the roles of each partner. 

We expect that within a maximum of 10 weeks of approval that we have commitments that will allow us to manufacture upwards of 10,000 units a month and are making this commitment after having received high confidence sourcing commitments.

## Risks & Challenges

Key risks and challenges contemplated at this time include the worldwide shortage of chips and select electronic components.

The risk of consumer market entry and adoption usual for many companies is much lower for Smart Mimic given our accumulated experience in the area.
