# T.M.G INDUSTRIES 
### Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per HIP19

# Summary
* Two sentences about who you are and what you’d like to build. Indicate if you are building a Light Gateway, or a Full Gateway. Bonus points to include photos and links.  

We are T.M.G INDUSTRIES we are a startup looking to build helium Gateways from what I understand we are technically building a light hotspot. We will be using the same components as a full hotspot to ensure all features work the same and that they will be more than capable for handling the required tasks.

# Company Information (required)
• What is your company name?  
T.M.G INDUSTRIES INC  
• How long have you been in business?  
We have been officially operating for 1 month   
• What kind of products have you created?    
We have not created products from scratch in the past  
• How many have you sold?      
We are a startup and haven’t sold anything as of yet     
• What brought you to Helium etc?    
I was recently getting into everything crypto and trying to understand it and start trading when I stumbled upon helium and started researching and found that helium is much more than a crypto currency and has great potential to become something huge while offering real benefit.  
 
# Product Information (required)
* Your time to shine! What are you building? What’s so great about it?    
• What is your approximate price point?  
Currently the approximate price is around 550-600usd as components are more expensive. However once we are able to reduce the price for components we will reduce the price our goal is to get the price to 350-400usd

# Detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts.
 • CPU:  
 Quad-Core Cortex-A7 1.6GhZ
 * Memory (SDRAM):   
 2GB DDR3
 * Onboard Storage:   
 16GB SD Card 
 * Onboard Network:   
 10/100 Ethernet RJ45
 * Power Source:   
 5V DC USB OTG
 * Low level peripheral:   
 40 Pin Header  
 * LoRa: LoRaWAN® multichannel concentrator module based on SX1308
 * Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos, videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better.  
 We are currently working on the prototype and will be able to provide photos etc
 
# Your plan for software setup and configuration for the devices. This would presumably include remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise.  
We intend to fully integrate our hotspots with the helium app allowing users to use all the features the app offers and apply OTA updates. 
 
# What is your expected production and delivery timeline? Photos and videos welcome.  
Our aim will be to produce and ship 2500-3000 units a week. Currently sourcing the components have not been much of an issue and we think that would be more than reasonable. Once we have the components in stock it will not take long to program and assemble. 

# Previous shipments (required)  
Startups welcome! Answer No if that's the answer.
* Have you shipped anything in the past?  
No  
* Which countries have you previously shipped regulatory FCC or CE approved products?  
No  
* Which countries do you plan to ship to?  
We plan to start shipping within Canada at first and then will expand to start shipping worldwide.   
 
# Customer Support (required)
* How will your customers be able to contact you for support for your products?  
Our customers will be able to reach us 24/7 through our discord channel and through our support email   
* For how long? How are you planning to handle repairs and replacements?  
We plan to offer a one year warranty on all hardware issues and or defects.   
* Hardware Security Element (required)  
The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured, potentially including:  
* Encrypted/locked-down firmware  
Yes we are looking to encrypt firmware  
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures like an ECC chip  
Yes we will be using a ATECC608  
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures.  
We plan to design the case where it will not be easy to open without the required tools. And are still looking into all anti tampering measures.   
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail)  
Yes we are more than willing to submit our prototype for audit and share any results with the community we want to be as transparent and honest with the community as possible regardless if that is in our failures as it’s part of creating trust within the community   

# Hardware Information (required)
* Please let us know:  
* Which security (swarm) element are you using?  
Yes we will be using a ATECC608  
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway (ie SX1302/03 & SX1250s or SX1301/08 & SX1255/57)  
We are using the sx1302  
We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs  
* Where are you sourcing your components from?  
Most of our components will be coming from our trusted partners in China   
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure?  
Our supplier can get us as many as we need to meet demands   
 
 
# Manufacturing Information (required)
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?  
No  
* Have you built gateways before?  
Yes for personal projects   
* How many gateways did you make?  
2  
* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.  
We will be outsourcing the components and will be assembling and programming in house. We currently have a small team that is more than capable of assembling and programming the units and we will expand as the demand increases. Our goal is to have around 6 teams of around 4-6 people within 2-3 months and continue to expand to meet demand   

# Proof of Identity
* Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives, e.g. as GitHub comments.
Contact details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub.  
Details have already been provided

# Budget & Capital (required)
* How many of these are you hoping to make and sell?  
We are hoping to make as many as the people need as long as there is demand we will produce them  
* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? What is your plan for additional financing if required? This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures -- getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.  
So far I have invested around 5000$ I am trying to fund this all personally which has been going very well however once we get our approval I will be able to get around 100000$ for inventory and to be able to fill orders without having to use the funds from the pre-sales. We are aiming to start with a smaller amount and grow gradually so that we can use our money to fill the orders and give the customers the option to cancel and get refunded if they choose. We are actively trying to reduce the cost of manufacturing each unit and we are in target to stay within our projections   
 
# Risks & Challenges (required)
* Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality, and how you might address them.  
Currently the biggest challenge has been getting our certification as the government has been very delayed in responding and this has slowed the application process down a lot however we will persevere besides that the only other challenges I see would be shipping however we are currently in talks with the major shipping companies in our area and are also looking into doing local deliveries as well. There will likely be other challenges along the way and we plan to overcome them and continue to move forward and continue to provide excellence we refuse to let our customers be affected by the challenges we may face.
