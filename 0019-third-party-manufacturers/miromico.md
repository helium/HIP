This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives, e.g. as GitHub comments. Contact details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub.

## Budget & Capital
We have a continuous lean production and sales with certain buffers to cope with components issues like its seen in the past months due to Covid-19. We were asked by some of our partners and customers to provide our MIro Edge plattform to the Helium network asap. We cannot say much about the volume of devices - but we are prepared to provide millions of devices if necessaray.


## Risks & Challenges
The current component crisis due to Covid-19 and trade wars is a serias thread to global supply chains and economy. We have a dedicated team dealing on daily base with this topic.
