# BorIoT
### Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per [HIP19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md)

## Summary

BorIOT is an IoT solution provider in Thailand with core competency in IOTs design and Manufacturing. We are providing gateway prototypes for both Helium Hotspot Miner and IOT devices. 

## Company Information

Founded in July 2021, BorIoT is an IoT technology company based in Bangkok, Thailand. Focuses on the development of  Internet of Things technology and also has certain research on blockchain technology. We are currently trying to combine IoT technology with blockchain to introduce fresh blood to the Helium community.

## Product Information

We provide 2 SKUs gateway prototypes.

- Pi4 Helium Hotspot Miner for In-Door Version (A brand new product, in development)
- Pi Compute Module 3, for Out-Door Version (A brand new product, in development)

Expected Release Date: Q4 2021
More LoRa gateways, including the Helium light hotspot, are developed in progress and will be released soon.

## Customer Support

Support will be provided over e-mail and Discord and general troubleshooting will be available on our website. We aim to respond to question within 1 business-day.
On our website we will provide clear information on the production  status of our product, and the batches to be expected. The ordering  process for our first product will collect payment-details during pre-ordering, but we will only charge the payment-method just  before we ship out the devices. We will limit pre-orders based on the  batches we have planned.
Full product warranty will be provided on Indoor and Outdoor for 1 years including Hardware and Software support.

## Hardware Security

We use the ECC608 chip as recommended by Helium to securely store the encrypted swarm keys. Also, we want to implement the following security items:

- Encrypted/locked firmware, so there won’t be possible for the user  to make any modification that will compromise the device’s security;
- Physical protection of the SD card slot, using security seals/tape.

We can send a device for an audit to test the hardware security.

## Hardware Information

We provide 2 SKUs gateway Indoor and Outdoor. More LoRa gateways, including the Helium light hotspot, are developed in progress and will be released after.

- Future version with RPi CM 4
- Ethernet 10/100 with surge protection
- ECC608 encryption chip
- 5V DC power supply
- Temperature range 0°C ~ +60°C
- Antenna Connector SMA Type

BRI-V01 Indoor Version 1

- Raspberry Pi 4
- Frequency AS923 with SX1302
- Gigabit Ethernet
- 5V / 3A DC power supply
- ECC608 encryption chip

## Proof of Identity

Proof of identity will be sent in private.

## Budget & Capital

We plan to proceed with a first batch of 1000 to 2000 units, but we can  ramp up if pre-order demand requires it. We have investment partners that we can leverage if necessary, but we currently have the capacity to produce up to 3000 units per month without external resources.

## Risks & Challenges

The product design and all technical parts of the project are nearly done. The main risks and challenges are the supply of Semtech’s SX1302 concentrator and assembly of the associated electronics. Fortunately,  BorIoT works with a local manufacturer which has a great throughput capability and knows and trusts they can deliver on schedule.
We will place the first production order immediately when we get manufacturer approval from Helium.
