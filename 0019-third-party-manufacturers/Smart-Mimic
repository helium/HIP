# Smart Mimic
### Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per [HIP19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md)

## Summary

Smart Mimic, in partnership with Sagem Teknoloji announces commitment to launch and sustain production of a consumer first, home ready, Finestra gateway family which is purpose built for the Helium Network. The friendly design, features designed for everyday use,  integrated managed cloud services and compatible Smart Mimic gadgets ensure that the gateway will not sit forgotten behind a cable-infested cabinet but be proudly displayed on a desktop or window sill. This is a game changer, not only ensuring ‘range optimal’ locations for the gateway but also driving word of mouth conversation.

With over 20,000 products in consumer hands Smart Mimic’s founding team has also established trusted relationships with industry leaders such as Helium and Semtech.

Sagem Teknoloji has been in advanced and high tech manufacturing for over twenty years. Sagem designs and manufactures sophisticated best in class products, electro-optic suites, cooled thermal camera and new generation laser range finders for Western militaries. They have successfully brought this expertise in extreme design and secure engineering to cost and design conscious high volume products.  Sagem worked with Meyer Objects on products like the Frame Clock design which won German Design Award in 2019 both for quality and outstanding detail. And also with startups like Smart Mimic where Sagem’s  knowledge in design for manufacturing (DFM), design for assembly (DFA) and Secure Manufacturing Methods (SMM) processes provides crucial product and competitive advantages.

Smart Mimic’s strategic partnership with Sagem Teknoloji allows it to move from conception and early design to sustained volume production very rapidly and covers rapid prototyping, mechanical design as well as electronics manufacturing including joint budgeting and revenue indexed credit arrangements.

## Device Management Cloud

All Smart Mimic Products come ready to connect with the Mimic Cloud, an advanced intelligent, state of the art device management system purpose built for Smart Mimic client devices. This allows Smart Mimic’s team to dynamically monitor device health and if necessary proactively intervene as well as notify customers of device power status and health, improving overall customer experience. That being said, the gateway is fully compatible with the Helium App and the Helium Network.

## Integrated Consumer Devices

Smart Mimic plans to provide enhanced integration for its devices - the Mimic GO and upcoming Mimic Track, including (optional) attractive bundle pricing for consumers. Regardless the gateway will be always available as a standalone device. 

## Customer Support

Smart Mimic has multiple years of experience in supporting thousands of end consumers customers in the US and elsewhere. We also run our own branded ecommerce store. In Q2 we will be rolling out our Mimic GO and Mimic Track products into Amazon and later in Q2/Q3 into prestigious Tier 1 Retail brands. These processes are already well underway.

In order to scale for this kind of growth we have already onboarded team members with years of Amazon / FBA experience. We have also established a sophisticated hybrid 3PL network  across the USA Including to support product returns. 

All products currently being sold in the US have included warranties with customer friendly return policies. We have also established processes for high speed replacements in the rare event of a product replacement.

We are scheduled for rollout into Canada, EU and Lat Am by Q3, with planned 3PL and distribution partners for those areas as well. They also include warranties and easy to access support. 

We carry the necessary insurance, either directly or via relevant contracted partners  (that ship, import, sell  products) and for end use of product. 


## Hardware Security

The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their `swarm_key` files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured, potentially including:

* Encrypted/locked-down firmware
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures like an ECC chip
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures.
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail)

## Manufacturing, Budget & Capital

Smart Mimic and Sagem Teknoloji have committed adequate capital to produce upwards of 10K units per month. Adequate budget for parts procurement, manufacturing and distribution have been set aside to meet this requirement keeping in mind the roles of each partner. 

We expect that within a maximum of 10 weeks of approval that we have commitments that will allow us to manufacture upwards of 10,000 units a month and are making this commitment after having received high confidence sourcing commitments.

## Proof of Identity

To be submitted privately to DeWi.

## Risks & Challenges

Key risks and challenges contemplated at this time include the worldwide shortage of chips and select electronic components.

The risk of consumer market entry and adoption usual for many companies is much lower for Smart Mimic given our accumulated experience in the area.
