## Previous shipments (required)

* Have you shipped anything in the past?
**We have shipped IoT products with WiFi, Bluetooth, LoRa(WAN), Sigfox and LTE-M world-wide since 2015**
* Which countries have you previously shipped regulatory FCC or CE approved products?
**World-wide**
* Which countries do you plan to ship to?
**World-wide**

## Customer Support (required)

* How will your customers be able to contact you for support for your products?
**Email support, Online Service Desk & moderated community forum**
* For how long? How are you planning to handle repairs and replacements?
**Support will be available during the lifetime of the product. Repairs and replacements will be handled through existing/established RMA processes.**

## Hardware Security Element (required)

The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their `swarm_key` files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured, potentially including:

* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures like an ECC chip
**Swarm key and data encryption key will be stored in the ECC chip**
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail)
**Yes**

## Hardware Information (required)

Please let us know:
* Which security (swarm) element are you using?
**ATECC608A**
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway (ie SX1302/03 & SX1250s or SX1301/08 & SX1255/57)
**SX1308 & SX1257**
* Where are you sourcing your components from?
**Semtech, global supply chain through EMS**
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure?
**Typically 6000 per week**

## Manufacturing Information (required)

* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?
**Yes. Pycom has successfully launched several radio hardware products (WiPy 2, LoPy1, SiPy, LoPy4, GPy, FiPy, Pygate, W01, L01, L04 and G01) since 2015 and sold hundreds of thousands of devices**
* Have you built gateways before?
**Yes, the Pygate on which this product is based**
* How many gateways did you make?
**12.000**

## Proof of Identity

Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives, e.g. as GitHub comments.
* Contact details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub.

## Budget & Capital (required)

* How many of these are you hoping to make and sell? **50.000**
* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? What is your plan for additional financing if required? This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures -- getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.
**We are past break even as a company**

## Risks & Challenges (required)

**Availability of components.**
