## Summary

FreedomFi will produce a version of FreedomFi Gateway (currently available for sale on [itâ€™s website]([http://www.freedomfi.com/product/](http://www.freedomfi.com/product/))]) that will be compatible with Helium blockchain. FreedomFi gateways will have the capability to mine helium for providing LoRaWan coverage via an integrated LoRaWan concentrator module, but will also offer the capability for end users to plug in any commodity CBRS small cell into the gateway to earn additional HNT rewards for providing network offload service to MNO and MVNO roaming partners.

FreedomFi is the open 5G company that offers the easiest path towards open source Private LTE or 5G networks.

## Product Information

### FreedomFi Gateway

**Status**: Ready to start production, CE testing passed.

**Expected release date**: Q3-Q4 2021

**Estimated price**: 500 USD

FreedomFi Gateway is a radio agnostic LTE/5G network core (aka EPC). It sits between the small cell radio and the Internet. Unlike a typical EPC, FreedomFi features a distributed, horizontally scalable data plane. That means instead of home-routing all of your traffic through a single choke point, you deploy many small gateways at the edge and all of them peer together into a single network with no single point of failure. You can use FreedomFi Gateways with LTE/5G radios from any vendor and, generally, deploy one FreedomFi gateway per cell site.

Under the hood, FreedomFi Gateway is based on Magma Access Gateway software that we test and bug fix to make it enterprise ready.

## Hotspot Fleet Management

FreedomFi Gateways are remotely undateable. Software used for updates is part of the open source Magma Orchestrator codebase. Additionally, we have a proactive monitoring system to monitor the devices and to allow us to troubleshoot remotely if agreed by the owner.

## Hardware Security
FreedomFi gateways developed for the Helium network will contain an Intel TPM security-chip for key-storage and cryptographic operations. Keys are non-exportable ensuring a high level of security.

## Manufacturing Information
FreedomFi partners with a variety of 3rd party ODMs to build the hardware based on FreedomFi specifications. Together with our suppliers we are planning to provide a combined volume (of 10,000+ units this year.
