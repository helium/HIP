# Manufacturer name
### Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per [HIP19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md)

## Summary

Two sentences about who you are and what you’d like to build. Indicate if you are building a Light Hotspot, or a regular Hotspot. Bonus points to include photos and links. 

## Company Information

Who are you? How long have you been in business? What kind of products have you created? How many have you sold? What brought you to Helium etc?

## Product Information

Your time to shine! What are you building? What’s so great about it? Do you have an approximate price point? Photos and videos welcome.

* Detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts
* Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos, videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better.
* Your plan for software setup and configuration for the devices. This would presumably include remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise.
* What is your expected production and delivery timeline?

## Customer Support

How are you planning to handle customer support for your products? For how long? How are you planning to handle repairs and replacements?

Please include how you plan on supporting the ongoing e-commerce store and community feedback in Discord.

Makers are required to maintain and staff a Discord channel to communicate with the community, respond in a timely manner (1 business day), able to provide detailed updates during pre-order period, and communicate in an official capacity on manufacturing status (blog post, website, store page are examples of “official” outlets).


## Hardware Security

The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their `swarm_key` files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured, potentially including:

* Encrypted/locked-down firmware
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures like an ECC chip
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures.
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail)

## Manufacturing Information

Have you built and delivered hardware projects before? If yes, how did it go, and how many did you make? If not, from whom will you get help? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.

## Hotspot Fleet Management
Please include a new section titled “Hotspot Fleet management plan” and outline how you plan on supporting Hotspot firmware updates, deployment, and rollback. In addition to a plan, please include how you plan on accomplishing/creating this dashboard. This can be a Maker-supplied support dashboard, or a compatible Hotspot fleet management dashboard.


## Proof of Identity

Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives, e.g. as GitHub comments. Contact details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub.

## Budget & Capital

How many of these are you hoping to make and sell? How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? What is your plan for additional financing if required? This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures -- getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.

## Risks & Challenges

Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality, and how you might address them.
