## Summary

A HIP to unify the Helium ecosystem into one token passed for IOT and HNT under HIP 138, but failed for MOBILE, thus, resulting in continued emissions of the MOBILE Decentralized Network Token (DNT). Therefore, starting January 15th, HNT will no longer continue to be emitted into the MOBILE subDAO treasury, effectively worsening the HNT/MOBILE treasury swap rate in perpetuity. This disadvantages those who previously locked MOBILE to support the governance of the sub network by not allowing them to swap their MOBILE at an optimal treasury swap rate. This HIP outlines the future of the MOBILE token as solely a governance token with no other purpose.

## Motivation

With the failure of HIP 138 on the MOBILE side, it has left the MOBILE community unsure of what is next for the MOBILE token. This HIP outlines the future of the MOBILE token and itâ€™s utility.


## Stakeholders

- MOBILE Holders
- MOBILE Hotspot/CBRS Deployers
- HNT Holders - will benefit by the increased burn of HNT for onboarding fees

## Detailed Explanation

If passed, this HIP shall impose the following:

- Any veMOBILE locked prior 0:00 UTC on November 21, 2024 shall become eligible for unlocking.
- All onboarding fees currently paid in MOBILE will be changed to the equivalent of HNT/DC
- veMOBILE will continue to be emitted via the current reward mechanism and follow its current emission schedule
- veMOBILE will continue to be used solely as a governance token to vote on MOBILE related HIPs
- Locking of MOBILE tokens to veMOBILE during a voting period will be prohibited/restricted to prevent vote sniping 
- The treasury swap function of HNT/MOBILE will continue until the MOBILE Treasury runs out of HNT


## Alternatives

One alternative is to purpose a re-vote of 138 on the MOBILE side, and introduce a new HIP on the HNT side to still obtain additional HNT for the MOBILE treasury; however, it is unclear if that would pass.

## Drawbacks

One drawback is having multiple tokens defeats the purpose of having a single token unified network.


## Deployment Impact

This proposal will be implemented by Helium core developers. 

## Success Metrics

This HIP is successful if the community has a better understanding of the purpose of the MOBILE token.
