# Problem Statement
[probem-statement]: #problem-statement

The `add_gateway` remains one of the few permissioned transactions relating to the network. Ideally, `add_gateway`
would be permissionless and any compatible hardware could be added to the blockchain and mine HNT. However, this
transaction has always been regulated due to a concerns with bad actors creating virtual hotspots only to maximize
mining rewards without truly providing coverage.

Initially, only gateways sold by Helium could be added to the blockchain, but [HIP19](0019-third-party-manufacturers.md)
expands this ability to approved vendors. One of the principal requirements of HIP19 is that the hotspot identity be
contained with a hardware security module.

While this does not prevent bad actors from lying about the packets they have seen, it does require bad actors to
acquire hardware and to maintain physical access to the hardware security module; thus the overhead of such operations
is increased and the scalability is hindered.

The fact remains though, bad actors may lie about radio packets. Virtually all POC gaming strategies revolve around
intercepting or entirely fabricating packets over the [Semtech GWMP Protocol over UDP](https://github.com/Lora-net/packet_forwarder/blob/master/PROTOCOL.TXT).

It is not difficult to put software between the packet forwarder and the Helium Miner to manipulated packets,
[as demonstrated by community member, Carniverous19/para1](https://github.com/Carniverous19/helium-DIY-middleman).

# Physical Root of Trust
[physical-root-of-trust-value-and-incentives]: #physical-root-of-trust-value-and-incentives

We propose to create a special category of packet forwarders which cannot lie about what they physically perceive. As
such, they provide the network with a **Physical Root of Trust**. They can still be "gamed" in various ways which will
be detailed here, but these attack vectors all end up existing at the physical RF level instead of simply intercepting
or fabricating UDP packets.

## Enabling DIY
[enabling-diy]: #enabling-diy

Currently, every single gateway design must pass through [HIP19](0019-third-party-manufacturers.md). However, DIY
concentrators go above and beyond the security requirements detailed in HIP19. Therefore, we propose that any gateway
assembly that features a DIY concentrator be allowed on-chain.

## A Foundation for Improved Trust
[a-foundation-for-improved-trust]: #a-foundation-for-improved-trust

While this proposal does not impact blockchain incentives at this point, we believe this approach should be considered
for a network-wide transition. We encourage approved vendors in considering adopting HIP22 complaint designs moving
forward.

Not only does this hardware module provide many potential avenues for preventing POC auditing, we believe that
a strong foundation of trust in the network's RF layer provides potential value to the users of the network. With the
Merkle roots in state channels, network users can already verify that a specific data frame was communicated via
the Helium Network at a certain time. With DIY concentrators, we may certify a location in a much stronger way.

Finally, we believe this approach to have high extensibility in improving POC auditing:
* actors capable of mobile auditing could be derived from this hardware
* more complex "trust score" and POC auditing approaches could derive itself from this data (eg: GPS timestamping)

# DIY Concentrator Definition
[diy-concentrator-definition]: #diy-concentrator-definition

A DIY Concentrator provides additional hardware security insofar as only secure firmware may operate the SX130x packet
forwarder and sign the packets, thus proving packets have not been manipulated in software. As such, suitable processors
must:
* provide a hardware key store, guaranteeing that a key generated within may not be extracted (similar to the ECC608)
* provide secure boot features, guaranteeing that only firmware signed by DeWi may executed (unlike ECC608, which does
  not execute firmware)

Additional efforts should be made to reduce ease of tampering with the radio inputs, although these solutions will be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Firmware will need to be released to DeWi for audit and signing of releases. Ideally, it should be open-sourced.

Manufacturers may be trusted to provision the concentrators themselves (ie: load the firmware which starts the chain of
trust) if and only if they have staked 5 or more validators. 

Alternatively, another party who meets the staking requirements could be engaged. In either case, ownership of these 
validators must be proven to DeWi.

In the future, we believe an enhanced DIY concentrator with fine GPS timestamping should be considered.

# Onboarding
[onboarding]: #onboarding

The following onboarding specification requires no blockchain features.

DIY concentrators will be subject to the same onboarding fees as regular hotspots. The `swarm_key` shall be stored
in the secure firmware and will be the entity signing the transactions. As such, the secure firmware will be responsible
for signing the `add_gateway` transaction.

The downside of this approach is that retrofits of existing gateways will essentially replace the previous identity with
a new HIP22 identity (ie: careful-pickel-squirrel will be replaced with long-fuchsia-sloth).

Provisioned concentrators will be provided to the DeWi-managed staking server, similar to HIP19-approved hotspots. As
such, the vendor of a DIY concentrator remains responsible for onboarding fees and must have these priced in for the
customer.

Vendors who are already approved via HIP19 shall manage a separate account for HIP22 concentrators, so that we have
some on-chain transparency of the different security models used for on-chain hotspots.

# Syncrob.it Product Summary
[product-summary]: #product-summary

Syncrob.it proposes a design which complies with this HIP based on the MAX32510 and a PCIe compatible interface (eg:
similar to the RAK2287), allowing it to be a potential retrofit for nearly every gateway on the network.

These "concentrator cards" are effectively one of Semtech's SX130x front-ends paired with a secure MCU. Over SPI, they
communicate back to the main processor, such as a Raspberry Pi. Should this HIP pass, a "DIY concentrator" will be
available for purchase.

Should existing gateway vendors provide software support, they could adopt these radio front-ends, either after-market
or in future products.

While Syncrob.it initially proposes this design, this HIP in no way precludes other vendors from certifying designs
that fit the definition above.

# Hardware and Firmware Summary
[hardware-and-firmware-summary]: #hardware-and-firmware-summary

![image Secure Concentrator](0022-diy-concentrators/concentrator.jpg)

The MAX32510 can provide a guarantee that the firmware on-board is unchanged. Along with a secure key-store, it also
provide a secure bootloader, ensuring that only signed firmware is booted.

The main attack vector would be tampering with the SX130x either directly on-board or over RF. Additional
anti-tamper mechanisms may be deployed to reduce ease of tampering.

In coordination with DeWi, the final design may
feature the following such protections:
* existing tamper proof features on the MAX32510
* firmware on the MAX32510 could detect PCB modifications
* an out of band check by the concentrator on the antenna port, ensuring that the stock antenna is deployed

Due to the signature from the packet forwarder, either an alternative protocol will need to be developed or an
additional field must be provided with a signature to the
[POC witness receipts](https://github.com/helium/proto/blob/master/src/blockchain_txn_poc_receipts_v1.proto#L22).

# Unresolved Questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

**HIP19 Transition**: Should HIP19 approved vendors be compelled to migrate to this increased security model?

**Operator Incentives**: As these modules are more secure than currently deployed infrastructure, should operators of
these DIY concentrators be provided with a POC rewards multiple?

# Deployment Impact
[deployment-impact]: #deployment-impact

The HIP19 process is fairly involved and requires case-by-case handling of each vendor. While this HIP initially enables
DIY gateways (therefore enabling hobbyists to source modules and build custom gateways), we believe its possible that
all future designs from large-scale vendors could comply with HIP22 and thus bypass HIP19. This would provide a higher
degree of trust in witness receipts from gateways while also reducing the overhead of the HIP19 process.

# Success Metrics
[success-metrics]: #success-metrics

If this HIP is successful, we should see the continued proliferation of a variety of gateways on the network while also
increasing trust in POC reports.in anti-gaming strategies.
