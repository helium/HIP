## Summary
This HIP proposes to make modifications to how Service Providers are eligible for rewards from the Service Provider MOBILE Reward bucket.

## Motivation
The primary motivation is to prevent a scenario in which a Service Provider is rewarded the full 10% MOBILE reward bucket (provided HIP79 passes) while burning little to no Data Credits.

## Stakeholders
Any and all Service Providers of the Helium MOBILE Network.

## Detailed Explanation
HIP53 specifies an overall rewards bucket for Service Providers but does not go into specifics of how rewards should be calculated based on the amount of data being offloaded. To prevent a scenario in which a Service Provider is rewarded the full 10% MOBILE reward bucket (provided HIP79 passes) while burning little to no Data Credits (DC), we propose to follow a similar usage-based approach as outlined in HIP10 for the IoT Network.
We propose that Service Providers are rewarded up to 1:1 in MOBILE tokens for the amount of DC burned during a reward period, similar to the approach in HIP10.  If the Service Providers collectively burn more DC than the equivalent amount of MOBILE tokens in the Service Provider reward bucket, each Service Provider will be rewarded proportionally to its share of DC burn.  If the Service Providers collectively burn less DC than the equivalent amount of MOBILE tokens, the remainder of the Service Provider bucket will not be minted.
To illustrate, here are two scenarios:
Value of DCs burned for data traffic is less than the Service Provider reward bucket (10% of MOBILE emissions).

DCs burned by SP        100,000,000
Price of DC             $0.00001
Price of MOBILE*        $0.0001
DCs burned in MOBILE**  10,000,000
10% SP bucket           500,000,000 MOBILE
SP rewards              10,000,000 MOBILE


Value of DCs burned for data traffic exceeds the Service Provider reward bucket (10% of MOBILE emissions).

DCs burned by SP        100,000,000,000
Price of DC             $0.00001
Price of MOBILE*        $0.0001
DCs burned in MOBILE**  10B
10% SP bucket           500,000,000 MOBILE
SP rewards              500,000,000 MOBILE


* The price chosen is an example, not the actual price. The actual price will be determined by the Price Oracle on the Solana blockchain during the rewards calculation time.
** Amount of MOBILE tokens with the same value as the value of the DCs burned by SP: (10,000 DC * $0.00001 (fixed price of DC) / $0.0001 (example price of MOBILE))

While approval of this approach is probably not necessary for Helium Mobile to start offloading data to the Helium Mobile Network, it does modify a policy that is important for Helium Mobile to function.

## Implementation
We leave the implementation of the smart contract components, verifiability, and Service Provider compliance up to the Helium Core Developers to determine.

## Drawbacks
There are no perceived drawbacks.

## Unresolved Questions
There are no unresolved questions.

## Dependencies
Nova Labs has done most of the work necessary to launch the Helium Mobile carrier on the data offloading, customer tooling, and support flows side. Launch of staking, Hotspot rewards, and other blockchain related functionality is dependent on the Solana migration and the successful implementation of these features by Helium Core Developers.

## Deployment Impact
Service Providers will be able to offload data traffic to the Helium Mobile Network and receive Service Provider rewards.

## Success Metrics
The main success metric would be Service Providers receiving their proportionate rewards from the MOBILE Reward bucket.
