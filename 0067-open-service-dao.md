# Summary
[summary]: #summary

[HIP 51: Helium DAO](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md) proposed that each communications network built on top of the Helium Network (LoRaWAN, WiFi, 5G, CDN, VPN â€” referred to as Decentralized Network Protocols or DNPs) has its own subDAO with its own token (referred to as Decentralized Network Tokens or DNTs). The key specifications of the DNP such as Proof-of-Coverage rules, mining rewards, and Data Transfer pricing are governed by each DNP subDAO.

For the services on CDN and VPN for example, there would be lots of projects that want to use Helium's Network to help run various services.
We think for many Heliums nodes, their bandwidth resources, storage spaces, device performance, and all idle resources today, should be more fully taken used now and in the future. 
So here we suggest Helium start an open service list for the projects who have the requirement to use Helium Network. And for the nodes of the helium network, they could choose to run for any services in the list as their wish, getting the extra motivation rewards in return.

And the services which could join the open list need to follow some standards made by the community.
It could build the Open-Service subDAO just like the IoT subDAO, Mobile subDAO, and WiFi subDAO, working in the same structure under Helium Network.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Meson Network would like to be one of the start projects to join the service list.
As a bandwidth trading platform, Meson Network takes use of idle bandwidth resources to help distribute files/data globally.

As a case, for example, this HIP could give the choice for some Helium nodes to deploy the services of Meson. If they do, We could use them to distribute the different kinds of files/data, and pay the service fee in return for how much it contributes. 

# Stakeholders*
[stakeholders]: #stakeholders
- Helium Official
- Helium Nodes Owener, as the service provider
- Meson Network, as the service purchaser and the proposer

# Rationale and Alternatives*
[alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives
This is your chance to discuss your proposal in the context of the whole design
space. This is probably the most important section!
- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not
  choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved Questions*
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the HIP process
  before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation
  of this feature?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this HIP that could be
  addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this
  HIP?

# Deployment Impact
[deployment-impact]: #deployment-impact

 - Make Helium Network more common used for multiple purposes.
 - Help the Helium Nodes Owners get more rewards.
 - Help the Development of the Internet, reducing the cost and improving the performance for their services.

# Success Metrics*
[success-metrics]: #success-metrics
What metrics can be used to measure the success of this design?
- What should we measure to prove a performance increase?
- What should we measure to prove an improvement in stability?
- What should we measure to prove a reduction in complexity?
- What should we measure to prove an acceptance of this by it's users?
