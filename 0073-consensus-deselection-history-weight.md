# Summary

[summary]: #summary

This change introduces a new, tunable, chain variable that improves performance
of the current Helium L1 by changing the selection algorithm of new Consensus
Group members. This change specifically adjusts the weight given to historical
penalties when selecting existing Consensus Group members to be removed. By
reducing (or even zeroing out) the previous penalties of Consensus Group
members, performance penalties earned in the current epoch have a larger impact
on the selection. This will help eject poor performers from the Consensus Group
more quickly and maintain overall high performance of the chain.

The core developers will have discretion to set this new chain var
(`election_penalty_history_percentage`) as they see fit in order to promote 
performance of the blockchain. Because it does change election dynamics which 
have a direct impact on validator operators, the core devs and I fell it is best 
to bring this change as a HIP with a vote amongst at least validator operators 
as they are the ones primarily affected.

The code for the change is already merged and tagged for release. However, it will
be activated only upon HIP approval by setting of `election_version` >= 7.

# Motivation

[motivation]: #motivation

The motivation for this change is to enable quicker removal of low performing
validators from the consensus group. With the current election system, we often
see obvious low performers with high total penalties continue to remain in the
consensus group. For example, the screen shot of CG member total penalty over
time shows clear outliers who persist in the group despite amassing penalties 4x
to 5x higher than average.

This change will help to remove these poor performers more quickly, by giving
higher weight to performance penalties in the current epoch.

# Stakeholders

[stakeholders]: #stakeholders

- Validator operators / owners - This change largely impacts validators as it
  directly impacts their likelihood of remaining in CG based on their
  performance
- Other network participants - If successful in achieving its goals, this change
  has the potential to improve the overall performance of the Helium blockchain,
  for example, allowing a higher PoC rate without impacting block production
  times

# Detailed Explanation

[detailed-explanation]: #detailed-explanation

This change enables additional tunability in the election process. Specifically,
it controls how much previous versus current epoch penalties are used in selecting
validators for removal from the current group. This change has two components:

1. Introduce new chain var `election_penalty_history_percentage` which is used
during scoring of existing group members before selecting members for removal.
This value controls whether and how much the previous penalties (those in the
ledger and thus earned outside of the current epoch) contribute to the score.\
\
Score for selecting to remove is thus:\
`[election_penalty_history_percentage] * [total existing penalty]) + [current epoch performance penalties] + [current epoch tenure penalty]`
\
Currently, score for deselection is\
`[total existing penalty] + [current epoch performance penalties]` 

2. Change the tenure penalty from being applied at the beginning of the round to 
being applied at the end of the round. This makes it so that the tenure penalty 
for the current group is not part of the previous penalties and instead is counted 
in the current epoch. This change is necessary because if the
`election_penalty_history_percentage` is zero, we still want to count the
current round's tenure penalty in the score for deselecting (i.e. validators
must have a non-zero score for the inverse cumulative distribution function
selection algorithm to work).

These changes are guarded behind `election_version` = 7. No changes are made in
the logic for selection of new validators into CG. That continues to be weighted
randomly based on the total penalty score at time of the election.

Note that when `election_penalty_history_percentage` is 1.0, the behavior of
consensus member deselection is nearly identical to the existing behavior. There
will be a miniscule difference in total penalty as the tenure penalty starts
decaying at the end of the epoch versus the beginning of the epoch.

To achieve the goal of more quickly removing low performers,
election_penalty_history_percentage should be kept at or near 0.0. This causes
the deselection to be based mostly/entirely on performance in the existing group
which is one of the most important considerations for a well functioning CG. In
the long-run, this will still provide equal rewards for equal performance. If
all validators perform perfectly during an epoch, the odds of being removed are
equal and thus on average will spend 4 consecutive epochs in CG.

# Drawbacks

[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

### DKG penalties scaled down

As part of this change, any DKG penalties will be considered as part of penalty
history since they are added to the ledger at the time of the consensus election
failure transaction. Thus, these penalties will also be scaled down. One could
argue that any DKG penalties should instead be counted in the current epoch
penalties. This is impractical given the way these penalties are stored. The
benefit of this change however will still outweigh this potential drawback.
Validators that fail DKGs are typically offline and also hit with large missed
seen and BBA penalties which will far outweigh their tenure penalty and give
them a large probability of being ejected. Also, the DKG penalties accrued will
still contribute to the total score which will reduce the odds of being elected
into future CGs until the penalties decay.

### Lower total penalties for poor performer

If poor performing validators are ejected from the CG more quickly, this means
that they will also accrue lower total penalties. This could result in a poor
performing validator becoming eligible for a new election sooner or with higher
probability. While this might be a bad thing for consistent poor performers, it
also helps limit the damage that occurs from occasional poor performance or
penalties caused by factors out of the control of operators (e.g., bugs in code,
temporary issues with colo provider/ISP, etc.). By ejecting them from CG sooner,
this gives an opportunity for the operator to mitigate the penalties accrued 
for a normally high performing validator such as by rolling back the validator 
version, resolving a hardware or hosting provider issue, etc.

# Rationale and Alternatives

[alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

An alternative that was considered was to incorporate an exponential component
to the deselection scoring. For example, total penalty score could be squared
before using for deselection probability. Higher total penalty would have an
exponentially higher probability of being removed. While this would limit poor
performers to some extent, the effect is not as strong as the proposed one
because long-tenure validators regardless of performance will have increasing
scores as well. To really focus on current performance, the solution in this HIP
is favored.

# Deployment Impact

[deployment-impact]: #deployment-impact

Deployment is controlled by setting `election_version` -> 7 and by setting a
value of `election_penalty_history_percentage` between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.

# Success Metrics

[success-metrics]: #success-metrics

Success will result in shorter tenure for validators that are incurring
significant performance penalties as well as the ability to increase the PoC
rate without impacting the block rate / HNT emissions.
