## Summary

This HIP proposes to introduce MNTD. as a Hotspot Vendor (as defined in HIP53) on the MOBILE Network. The intention is to expand coverage for the Network with an additional maker and supplier. The HIP describes integration with the Helium Mobile Network, an anti-gaming mechanism, and overall impact on the Network.

## Motivation

MNTD.’s parent company, RAKwireless is one of the longest aligned stakeholders and supporters of the Helium Network and its community’s mission. The company has sold over 240,000 IOT Hotspots and is one of the largest providers of sensors using the IOT Network. Becoming a MOBILE Hotspot vendor is aligned with both MNTD.’s commercial interests and healthy growth of the MOBILE subNetwork. MNTD. is excited to continue supporting the growth of the Helium Network and brings a 10-year history of building high-quality wireless hardware.

## Stakeholders

This HIP affects:

- Helium Mobile Subscribers (US)
- Helium Mobile Service Provider
- Non-US Service Providers and/or MOBILE Network roaming partners
- MOBILE token holders, given the 50M MOBILE lockup and rewards allocation

## Detailed Explanation

The staking amount and rewards for a MOBILE Network Hotspot vendor follow those outlined in HIP53.

## Governance

HIP53 specifies two conditions which a Hotspot Vendor needs to meet to be allowed to operate on the Mobile Network:
- Stake a minimum of 50M MOBILE
- Obtain MOBILE subDAO governance approval

Additionally, MNTD. has worked with the Helium Foundation to obtain a penetration test from a reputable 3rd party security vendor, of which the Foundation [can attest to the results](./files/0117/helium-foundation-attestation.pdf).

## Implementation

Upon a passing community vote by veMOBILE holders, MNTD. will lock 50M MOBILE as instructed by the Helium core developers and be granted a “maker key” by the Helium Foundation to onboard MOBILE Hotspots.

As additional accountability and Network protection measures:
1. MNTD. has entered into a contractual agreement with Nova Labs, currently operating the sole Service Provider on the Helium ecosystem, to ensure customer protection. As the Helium network expands and new Service Providers emerge, MNTD is prepared to establish similar agreements with them, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of service and safeguarding the interests of the Helium community.
2. MNTD. will abide by a MOBILE Network contract with the Helium Foundation to ensure sufficient onboarding credits, firmware updates, and a reasonable level of responsiveness.

MNTD. MOBILE Hotspot owners will retain 100% of rewards.

## Drawbacks

We do not currently see any drawbacks to adding a new maker to the MOBILE maker ecosystem.

## Unresolved Questions

Unresolved questions may be added to this section as community discussion begins.

## Deployment Impact

- Expanded supply of Helium MOBILE Hotspots
- 50M MOBILE is taken out of circulation

## Success Metrics

The main success metric would be growth of the MOBILE Hotspot population providing network coverage. Secondary is a growth in cellular data running through the MOBILE Network.
