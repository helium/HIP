# Summary

This HIP proposes a change to how Proof-of-Coverage (PoC) Challenges are
generated and submitted to the Helium blockchain to allow for further network
scalability and to lower the hardware complexity/cost of Hotspots. Specifically,
it moves the responsibility of PoC Challenge creation to Validators and
consequently proposes moving the economic reward for creating Challenges to this
group as well.

# Motivation

Originally Hotspots were the only kind of entity on the network; they were
responsible for block production, Challenges/Witnesses, etc. With the switch to
Validators we moved beyond that model for block production, but we still have
significant computational overhead and complexity on Hotspots as a result of the
old design and constraints of Proof-of-Coverage.

This complexity has become a significant pain point, Hotspots must now keep up
with a blockchain that is produced on significantly more powerful hardware and
they must contend with an enormous peer-to-peer (p2p) network to route
Challenges and witness reports. The global chip shortage have also made it
harder to source capable hardware for building Hotspots that can meet these
requirements.

To address these issues the core developers have been working on design and
implementation of an alternative PoC Challenge mechanism we call Validator
Challenges. In brief, Validator Challenges move the role of generating
Challenges to the Validator pool. This not only allows us to free Hotspots from
the burden of following the blockchain but it also moves the entities initiating
Challenges to machines with much more stable and predictable networking which
reduces the likelihood of connectivity failures. Hotspots can become clients of
Validators to learn about blockchain updates in general, whether or not they're
currently being challenged, and where to deliver Witness receipts.

# Detailed Explanation

## Description of Current Implementation

It is useful to recapitulate the current challenge process. First refer to the
Detailed Explanation section of [HIP 54: H3Dex-based PoC Targeting][hip54] which describes
how a challenge is constructed and submitted to the blockchain.

1. Once the PoC Request has appeared on the blockchain and the Challengee has
   been selected, the Hotspot attempts to connect to it over p2p (potential
   failure point). If successful it sends the challengee the data to transmit.
2. The Challengee then consults its local blockchain ledger to see if the PoC is
   active. This is another potential failure point if the Challengee is not
   synced.
3. The Challengee then transmits the packet and sends a receipt to the
   Challenger over the same connection from the Challenger. This is another
   potential p2p failure.
4. Any Hotspots observing the challenge packet then consults their local
   blockchain ledger to see if they can find the Challenger based on the packet
   they received and Challenge data on the blockchain. This is another potential
   failure point if the witness is not in sync with the blockchain.
5. If the Challenger is found, the Witnessing Hotspot attempts to dial them over
   p2p, another potential failure point.
6. Once the Challenger has decided enough blocks have passed it submits the
   `poc_receipt` transaction to the blockchain to report on the information
   gathered (if any). The final, potential failure point is if the Challenger is
   lagging behind the blockchain and takes so long to submit the receipt that
   the PoC has expired.

So, as can be seen from above there are a number of potential failure points in
this process. These failures are all related to the speed/size of the blockchain
and the size of the p2p network. When the network was smaller this was much less
of an issue, but with over 500,000 Hotspots on the network now and larger
blocks, these failures are becoming more and more common.

An important aspect of this system is that the actual challenge entropy is kept
secret until the receipt transaction is published. This requires Hotspots to
observe the actual data from the Challenger to correctly respond to the
challenge and prevents poisoning attacks. However Hotspots can verify the
challenge information against the blockchain once they see it.

## Light Hotspots & gRPC

Light Hotspots will maintain a durable gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) connection to one (or many)
Validators.  The target Validator(s) could be random or specified.  Via the
first durable connection, Light Hotspots will be streamed chain related data,
events and notifications. Additional connections can be considered ephemeral
and used for lookup requests if needed.

All messages sent to a Light Hotspot from a Validator will be wrapped in a top
level message (Protocol buffer schema provided below).  This message includes
metadata which serves as an attestation on behalf of the sending Validator. The
attestation data includes:

- Signed payload of the message
- Block age, height, and time when the payload was signed

### PoC Challenge Creation and the Consensus Group

Today, each block on the blockchain includes metadata (BBA seen, timestamps, etc) and
transactions. With this change, each Validator will generate
a set of ephemeral key pairs and a hash of the public keys will be included in Validator heartbeat txns
whilst the private key will be saved to local state on the generating Validator.
During absorb of a heartbeat txn, if the proposed keys do not belong to a Consensus Group member they will be added to a local cache 'poc_key_proposals'.
We propose a fixed `poc_challenge_rate` parameter to be added to the
chain that defines the target number of Challenges per block. Each Consensus
Group member will deterministically select a certain number of keys from the 'poc_key_proposals' cache in order to ensure that we
will meet this target. Assuming there are a minimum of `2f+1` nodes
participating in a block, we are able to reach `poc_challenge_rate` if each
Validator in the Group can select enough Challenges to fulfill this formula:

![\frac{\text{PoC Challenge Rate}}{\frac{N-1}{3}* 2}][poc-challenge-rate]

The set of agreed on public keys hashes will then be deterministically truncated
(in case there are more than `2f+1` participating to `poc_challenge_rate` and
form part of the block metadata. Selected keys will be removed from the 'poc_key_proposals' cache.
The advantage of a fixed `poc_challenge_rate`
is that regardless of Hotspot growth, this value can remain fixed unless changed
through governance and can be adjusted based on the ability for Validators to
serve the capacity needs of the network. This avoids the need for periodic
changes to `poc_challenge_interval` as we do today in order to reduce load on
the network.

Upon handling a block, each Validator will inspect the public keys
in the block, identify any of their own keys, and for each, initiate a new PoC.
The public key hash will be used with the block hash to generate entropy to
generate an H3 region for the Challenge.  Entropy from a combination of the
associated private key hash and the block hash will then be used to identify the
target within the region to generate the Challenge itself. The region,
challenge, and target will be persisted locally on the Challenger Validator.

### Validators & Light Hotspot Communication

All Validators, whether they are in consensus or not, sync blocks normally to
keep up with the blockchain. As a part of normal processing, they will pull the
public key hashes from the block metadata and, with the block hash, generate the
same entropy as the Challenger Validator to identify the target H3 region.
The Validators will then pull a list of all Hotspots within that region and send
each Hotspot connected to them a notification message informing them of a
challenge within their region. The notification provides the onion key hash of
the Challenge and, more importantly, the necessary routing data (public key and
IP) to enable the Light Hotspot to connect to the Challenger Validator.

All Hotspots, upon receipt of a challenge notification, will send a request over
gRPC to the Challenger Validator to check if they are the target.

The request will be signed by the Challengee and also include the onion key hash
it received from their Validator.  The Challenger will verify the signature of
the requesting Hotspot and, if it is indeed the target, a Challenge onion
payload will be returned.

Upon receipt of the Challenge payload, the Challengee will then transmit the
Challenge packet as described above and as currently exists in the Helium
network.

### Observing Hotspots and Witnessing

Any Light Hotspot hearing the transmitted packet will serve as a Witness as we
have today on the Helium network. However, rather that submit their Witness
report over libp2p, they will now submit over gRPC. The Witnessing Hotspot uses
the Validator(s) they are connected to as a client to lookup the Challenger
Validator by the hash of the PoC packet. The Light Hotspot then uses this
routing information to directly submit the Witness receipt to the Challenger.
Please see the Attestation section below on how the Validator providing data to
Light Hotspots can be verified.

The Challenger, after the `poc_timeout` number of blocks, will create a
`blockchain_txn_poc_receipts_v2` transaction, using received Challengee receipts
and Witness reports, and submit it to the blockchain thereby completing the PoC
challenge.

### Attestation and Slashing enablement

All messages originating from a Validator containing an assertion about the
blockchain will be attested. This includes messages not described in this
document.

If a Light Hotspot receives a message from a Validator and needs to act on it
(e.g., contacting a Challenger Validator to submit receipts) the Light Hotspot
will include the attestation in its request to that Challenger Validator. The
attestation provides evidence on behalf of the Light Hotspot to the Challenger Validator
that it received the instruction and/or data that resulted in the said action.

If the Challenger Validator member determines the instruction/data was spurious in
nature, unsolicited, or otherwise untrustworthy then the member can decide to
act on this. This allows for future implementations where the verifiably false
assertion is published, with the malicious Validator's attestation, to allow for
slashing of the Validator's stake.

Similarly, Light Hotspots themselves, if they determine the message received from
a Validator is untrustworthy, can build their own untrusted list of Validators.

### PoC Challenger Rewards

Today, the Hotspots creating PoC Challenges and submitting receipts to the
blockchain are rewarded with 0.9% of HNT rewarded per epoch. We propose that
this subsidy be moved to the Validator Challenger that is creating and collecting
Challenge data and submitting this information to the blockchain. We don't recommend
any other changes at this time
as it would increase the scope of implementation. Please refer to [HIP
10][hip10] or [docs.helium.com][docs] for the details of the current reward
scheme for PoC and specifically for Challengers.

We believe that there could be a future iteration of Validator Challengers that
could introduce a separate group responsible for Challenges only but
this is also too complex as an initial design. This would also remove the
ability to piggy back Challenges onto existing block production (which will
massively lower the blockchain's transaction rate).

### New Chain Variables

- `poc_challenger_type`: This chain variable allows us to control if Validators
  are responsible for creating challenges on the network. Activating this HIP
  requires setting this value to `validator`.
- `poc_challenge_rate`: This chain variable represents the target number of
  challenges per block. We propose an initial value of: `TODO`
- `poc_timeout`: This chain variable represents the number of blocks a
  Challenger will wait before collecting all available Challengee and Witness
  data and submitting a receipt transaction to the blockchain. We propose an
  initial value of `TODO`
- `poc_receipts_absorb_timeout`: This chain variable represents the number of
  blocks after the timeout where public PoC data will remain on the local ledger
  of Validators. This allows Validators to garbage collect this data so it can
  conserve space for future Challenges but ensures that the information is
  available to allow sufficient time for absorbing the transaction. We propose
  an initial value of `TODO`

# Drawbacks

This is a fairly extensive change to the network and may be disruptive if not
executed well. This also somewhat disturbs the economics of the system by moving
the Challenger rewards (currently 0.9% of rewards) from Hotspots to Validators.
By moving PoC Challenges away from the Hotspots, we also lose a potential
"liveness" check that can be used to determine whether or not a Hotspot is
online and instead we must rely solely on Data Transfer and PoC activity.

# Rationale and Alternatives

Simpler designs would include retaining the Hotspot initiating the Challenge,
just via information submitted/received via a Validator. This would involve less
change but it would not remove the reliance on p2p routing.

Other designs include proposals like "self beaconing" but those create a
significantly weaker security model and enables more opportunity for collusion.
Such a design also would not allow for further enhancements to how PoC packets
are transmitted.

# Unresolved Questions

This plan *does* consider and allow for Validator slashing to the extent the
data payloads exchanged between the Light Hotspots and the Validators will include
attestation data. This can enable a slashing
mechanism.  It does not however propose the slashing implementation itself, that
could be proposed in a future HIP.

This plan also allows for an establishment of tracking which Validators that
Hotspots are using for their source of blockchain information but it does not
propose what to use that information for, like affinity or delegation. We leave
this for a future proposal as well.

This plan, finally, allows for a change to how Challenges work and would allow
for multiple challengees to be involved in transmitting packets. This could
reduce the scope for collusion between a Challengee and Witnesses and also
obtain better positional information as a result of the Challenge. This has been
described in other forums as "Region" or "Multi-Hotspot" Challenges. This is out
of scope for this HIP but we imagine future work in this direction could be
possible.

# Deployment Impact

Overall users should see more reliable Challenge behaviour, less data use on the
Hotspot (which makes cellular/satellite backhaul Hotspots more feasible) and
effectively immediate onboarding of new Hotspots (no need to sync the chain or
load a snapshot in order to participate in PoC or transfer Data on the Helium
Network).

Hardware costs for Hotspots could potentially go down as the hardware
requirements can be relaxed to reflect the lower demands of the new challenge
model.

## How will existing documentation/knowlegebase need to be supported?

Documentation will need to be updated to explain the new model, this HIP can
serve as a reference.

## Is this backwards compatible?

The activation would be done via a set of chain variables which would switch the
system over to this new model, before that happens we need the new code to be
merged, deployed to the fleet (routers, hotspots, validators, node users) and
this HIP needs to be ratified.
