## Summary and Motivation

There are two types of LoRaWAN frames: Join and Data. These each have their own
header to enable routing. On the Helium Network, we have a mechanism for
routing each type of packet to the appropriate Organizational Unique Identifier
(OUI). OUI operators are the entity that purchases packets on the Helium
Network.

### Join Frame

```
+---------------------------------------------------------+
|   Size (octets)  |      8     |      8     |      8     |
+------------------+------------+------------+------------+
|   Join Request   |   JoinEUI   |   DevEUI   |  DevNonce  |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
```

Join frames are routed on the Helium Network thanks to the filters maintained
by each OUI. These filters are written onto the blockchain by the OUI operator
and indicate interest in purchasing those Join frames that have matching
(JoinEui, DevEui). When a hotspot (LoRaWAN gateway) receives a Join packet,
it will cycle through each OUI and each filter for each OUI to check if they
are interested in this Join frame.

### Data Frame

```
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   Size (octets)  |     4      |      1     |      2     |    0..15   |
+------------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
|   FHDR           |  DevAddr   |    FCtrl   |     FCnt   |    FOpts   |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Data frames are routed thanks to their DevAddr. The DevAddr is assigned after
a successful Join (JoinRequest followed by JoinAccept). The DevAddr field is as
follows:

```
+------------------------------------------------+
|                     DevAddr                    |
+------------------------+-----------------------+
|   NwkID (bits 31–25)   |  NwkAddr (bits 24–0)  |
+-----------+--------------------+---------------+
|     Helium Network     |   allocated by slab   |
|        NetworkID       |      to OUIs          |
+-----------+--------------------+---------------+
```

If the NwkID (aka NetID) matches that of the Helium Network, the bottom 25-bits,
aka: NwkAddr, is used to determine which OUI this device belongs to. OUIs can
purchase one or many "slabs" of NwkAddrs; they can then allocate devices to
these addresses in their JoinAccept responses and expect that hotspots will
offer these Data frames to them.

### Non-Helium NetIDs

Currently, packets that are not under the Helium NetID are dropped. They belong
to other networks, such as Actility or Senet. However, these other networks
have manifested interest in purchasing these packets and thus "roaming" on the
Helium Network. Ultimately, enabling this makes the existing infrastructure
more valuable as the same hotspots (LoRaWAN gateways) can provide coverage for
these existing LoRaWAN Networks.

**We need a way to tell hotspots that one or many OUIs is interested in
purchasing Data frames from another network.** The existing mechanism for Join
frames requires no changes.

## Solution

We propose to create a new `chain_var` that maps NetID to OUI. It will be of
the following type:

```
[{<<netid:32/integer>>, <<oui:64/integer>>}]
```

This mapping will be maintained by the DeWi LoRaWAN Committee who can receive
requests from NetID owners to route these frames to one or many OUIs. The
entity making the request must be confirmed by the contact person listed in the
LoRaWAN Alliance NetID registry, which DeWi has access to as a LoRaWAN Alliance
Contributor. The OUI operator(s) need not be the same as the entity making the
request.

## Alternate Solutions

We could conceive of a system where any OUI operator could submit interest in
purchasing packets for a NetID via a permissionless transaction. However, this
is a direct violation of LoRaWAN Alliance requirements agreed by DeWi upon
joining the LoRaWAN Alliance and receiving a LoRaWAN NetID allocation.
Furthermore, bad actors could exploit this mechanism to harvest data from the
Helium Network without even compensating hotspot operators.
